### Essays / Personal Statement Theme

David's essay centers on the moment he realized technology could be a great equalizer. He describes watching his mother struggle to help him with math homework because she never went past 6th grade in Mexico. He taught himself to code not just to advance himself, but to build tools that help families like his access resources (his food bank app).

Pivotal quote from essay:
> "Every line of code I write is a bridge - from where my parents started to where I'm going, built so my younger siblings have an easier path to follow."

**Manager at Restaurant:**
> "In 20 years hiring teenagers, I've never seen work ethic like David's. He's never late, never complains, and manages school, work, and family with maturity beyond his years. Any university would be lucky to have him."
