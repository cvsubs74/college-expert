    "executive_summary": "Loyola Marymount University (LMU) is a premier private Jesuit and Marymount research university located on a bluff in West Los Angeles. Classified as an R2 doctoral university with high research activity, LMU emphasizes the 'education of the whole person' (cura personalis), blending academic rigor with a commitment to service and social justice. It is particularly renowned for its School of Film and Television, College of Business Administration, and strong undergraduate teaching.",

        "insight": "While the overall acceptance rate hovers around 45%, admission to the School of Film and Television (SFTV) is drastically more competitive, with internal transfer to Film Production currently closed due to capacity.",
        "implication": "Applicants must apply directly to their intended major, especially for arts and engineering, as internal mobility into impacted programs is restricted."
      },
      {
        "category": "Financial",
        "insight": "The total Cost of Attendance exceeds $92,000 annually, but LMU offers substantial merit scholarships ranging from $1,000 to full tuition (Arrupe/Presidential) to offset costs.",
        "implication": "High-achieving students should target the January 15 deadline to maximize merit aid consideration, as the sticker price is among the highest in the region."

The social scene is active but less dominated by Greek life compared to USC, with many upperclassmen socializing in nearby Westchester or Playa Vista.",
      "transportation_impact": "While 91% of freshmen live on campus, a car or rideshare is essential for exploring Los Angeles. The campus is somewhat isolated on a bluff, making it a 'bubble' within the city.",
      "research_impact": "As an R2 institution, LMU prioritizes undergraduate research through programs like the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) and Rains Research Assistantships, allowing students to collaborate directly with faculty."
