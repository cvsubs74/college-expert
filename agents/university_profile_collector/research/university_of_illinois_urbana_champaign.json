The availability of bikes racks on buses and the designation as a 'Bicycle Friendly University' also promote active transportation.",
      "research_impact": "UIUC is classified among 'R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity' and had $652 million in research expenditures in fiscal year 2019. The university offers numerous undergraduate research opportunities, including summer programs like the Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) for underrepresented students. There are various research programs and centers, such as the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and the Rail Transportation and Engineering Center (RailTEC). Undergraduate students can engage in research with faculty mentors through programs like Illinois Scholars Undergraduate Research (ISUR) and CS Student Ambassador/Research Scholars (CS STARS), with opportunities to present their findings at events like the Undergraduate Research Symposium. The university's strong research output and highly-ranked programs, particularly in engineering and computer science, contribute to its reputation and employer preference."

Be aware that transferring from a CS+X major to pure CS or Engineering CS is still very difficult. For other competitive engineering majors, if applying undeclared in engineering, it is recommended to list a maximum of two competitive majors among the three choices and aim for a high GPA (e.g., 3.5+ for competitive, 3.7+ for Computer Engineering) for better chances of securing a desired major."
