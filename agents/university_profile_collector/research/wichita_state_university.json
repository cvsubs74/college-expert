    "alternate_major_strategy": "Alternate Major Strategies: ['Consider a Less Competitive Entry Point: For highly competitive \"professional programs\" such as Nursing, Social Work, Dental Hygiene, or Medical Laboratory Sciences, admission into the university does not guarantee entry into the specific program. If a student\\'s first-choice major is one of these competitive programs, they might consider applying to a related, less competitive major within the same college or a broader \"undecided\" category initially. This allows them to gain admission to the university and then work with advisors to meet the specific requirements for their desired program.', 'Utilize the \"Undecided\" Option: Students who are unsure of their major can enroll as \"LAS undecided\" within the Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The Career Development Center can assist these students in exploring options and choosing a major that aligns with their interests. The General Studies major also provides flexibility, allowing students to combine a main area of study with two additional areas from different departments or colleges.', 'Plan for Internal Transfer: For students who are not admitted directly into their first-choice competitive major, an internal transfer strategy is available. Students can change their major after applying or being admitted. If a new student has not yet enrolled, they should contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions to change their major. Once enrolled, students can typically change their major up to three times per semester through their myWSU portal.']; Internal Transfer Difficulty and Impacted Majors: ['Competitive Internal Transfer for Professional Programs: Admission into professional programs can be very competitive, and meeting general university admission requirements does not guarantee entry into these specific programs. Some academic colleges and specific majors may also require a higher GPA than the general university admission requirement of a 2.00. For example, graduate programs like the MS in Business Analytics and the Management Science and Supply Chain Management (MSSCM) often require a minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.00. Changes to professional programs like Nursing or Social Work must be facilitated by an advisor in the relevant college or department.', 'No Explicit List of \"Impacted Majors\": While the term \"impacted major\" is not explicitly defined with a list, the repeated emphasis on the competitiveness of \"professional programs\" indicates that these are the majors where internal transfer might be more challenging due to limited capacity and specific admission criteria.']; summary: In summary, for highly competitive programs at Wichita State University, a proactive alternate major strategy involves either starting as \"undecided\" to explore options or selecting a related, less competitive major with the intention of meeting specific prerequisites and applying for internal transfer later. Close collaboration with academic advisors is crucial for navigating these pathways successfully."
