      "Identify and Prepare for Competitive Programs: Be aware that certain majors at Western Michigan University, such as Aviation Flight Science and direct admission to the Bronson School of Nursing, are highly competitive and have specific, earlier application deadlines and requirements for first-year and transfer students. If you are interested in these fields, ensure your application meets all criteria, including any optional supplemental materials like recommendation letters or essays, and is submitted by the Early Action deadline (December 15 for first-year students for both programs, and February 15 for transfer students for Aviation Flight Science).",
      "Utilize Exploratory Advising if Undecided: Western Michigan University embraces students who are exploring their academic interests. If you are unsure about your major, you can apply as undeclared and take advantage of their \"Exploratory Advising\" services. This approach allows you to explore various options with dedicated support to help you find a path that aligns with your passions and career goals. The College of Arts and Sciences, for instance, actively supports students uncertain about their major through resources like career self-assessments and career advisors.",
      "Understand Pre-Major Requirements for Certain Fields: For some programs, you may initially be placed into a \"pre-major\" status before gaining full admission to the major. For example, students interested in Communication or Psychology within the College of Arts and Sciences, Graphic Design or Theatre in the College of Fine Arts, or teacher certification programs in the College of Education, will initially be in a \"pre-program\" until specific departmental requirements are met. It's important to understand these internal admission requirements for your intended field of study.",
      "Be Prepared for Potential Major Changes: Nearly 45% of WMU students change their major during their academic careers, and the university's Academic Advising ensures this process is manageable and consistent. If you find your interests shifting, the university provides resources and a clear process for changing your major, and an academic advisor can help you review requirements and plan your academic progression efficiently.",
      "Research Major-Specific Demand: While Western Michigan University has a generally high acceptance rate (around 85%), the existence of \"competitive admission programs\" indicates that demand and ease of entry can vary significantly by major. Researching the specific demand and capacity limits for your desired major, beyond the explicitly competitive ones, can offer a more strategic approach to your application."

    "alternate_major_strategy": "Western Michigan University encourages an 'Exploratory Path' and provides a 'Parallel Major List' for career alignment, suggesting flexibility in selecting alternate majors. Students can also work with advisors to customize majors. If not admitted to a competitive major, students are likely considered for general university admission or other declared majors.",
    "internal_transfer_difficulty": "Internal transfer into highly competitive and impacted majors suchs as Aviation Flight Science and direct admission to the Bronson School of Nursing is difficult due to high demand and capacity limits; Aviation Flight Science is currently not accepting major changes. For most other majors, changing a major after admission is a common and relatively straightforward process, though some may require advisor consultations or specific academic prerequisites."
