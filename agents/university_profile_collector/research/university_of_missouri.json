Minimum GPA requirements are 2.5 for Missouri and Illinois residents and 2.75 for non-residents. The university calculates a 'Core GPA' for admission purposes, which includes grades from English, science, social studies, and foreign language courses; math courses Algebra I and higher; and the highest fine art grade. This Core GPA is used for students graduating from non-ranking high schools. Approximately 33% of freshmen were in the top ten percent of their high school graduating class. The school considers rigorous high school curricula, such as honors, AP, or IB classes. Standardized test scores (SAT/ACT) are optional for admission but are considered if submitted."

This is not a direct freshman admission requirement. The portfolio review is a selective process based on coursework from specific first-year classes (e.g., ARCHST 1100 Visual Design and ARCHST 1200 Drafting) and academic achievement. The portfolio should include creative projects and technical drawing work, with attention to craftsmanship and detail. Evaluation criteria include skills in design principles and elements, design creativity, drafting and lettering, technical accuracy, and craftsmanship. Portfolio and application materials are typically submitted in May."
