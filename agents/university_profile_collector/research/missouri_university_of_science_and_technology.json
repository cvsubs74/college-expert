If a student's academic profile is strong but they are concerned about the intense competition in these highly sought-after disciplines, exploring other strong STEM-related fields, or programs within the College of Arts, Sciences, and Business, might be a strategic approach.",
      "Consider an undeclared option within a broader college. Missouri S&T offers degrees within the College of Arts, Sciences, and Business, in addition to the College of Engineering and Computing. While not explicitly detailed for admissions, applying undeclared within a broader college could offer more flexibility and potentially a different entry path than direct admission to an impacted engineering program. Once admitted, academic advisors can assist students in exploring and planning their degree paths.",
      "Research the demand and typical profile for specific majors. Although major-specific acceptance rates are not readily available, understanding which majors are most popular can provide insight into potential competitiveness. Mechanical Engineering, General Computer & Information Sciences, and Civil Engineering consistently show high numbers of graduates, indicating their popularity and likely higher applicant pools. Applicants can gauge the potential demand for their intended major by reviewing such data and aligning their choice with their academic strengths and aspirations."

      "Focus on Student Outcomes and Value Proposition: Rankings often consider return on investment (ROI), which includes factors like low student debt and the time it takes for graduates to earn back their education costs. A strategy should prioritize keeping tuition and living expenses manageable, offering competitive financial aid, and demonstrating the clear economic benefit of a degree from Missouri S&T's colleges. This also ties into strong graduation and retention rates.",
      "Cultivate Academic Rigor and Student Support: Missouri S&T is recognized for its rigorous academic programs, especially in STEM fields. Maintaining high academic standards, coupled with supportive learning environments like small class sizes and accessible professors, helps ensure student success, which in turn positively impacts retention and graduation rates. Expanding resources such as tutoring and academic advising within each college further supports student achievement.",
      "Showcase Specialized Program Excellence: Missouri S&T's engineering and STEM programs frequently receive high marks, with specific programs like Civil Engineering and Environmental/Environmental Health Engineering ranking in the top 50. A strategy involves actively promoting and investing in areas of distinct academic strength within its colleges, demonstrating leadership in specific fields, and highlighting unique research opportunities and faculty expertise in those areas."
    ],
    "alternate_major_strategy": "alternate_major_strategy: Missouri S&T's undergraduate application for first-time freshmen asks applicants to 'Select the major you wish to pursue' under 'Area of Study'. It advises against selecting 'Undecided or Undecided Engineering' for international students, implying a single major selection at the application stage. Therefore, rather than listing a separate alternate major on the initial application, a strategic approach would involve choosing an initial major that aligns with a student's interests and abilities, especially if their primary interest is in a highly competitive field like certain engineering disciplines. If the primary desired major is highly competitive, students might consider applying directly to a less competitive but related major that still genuinely interests them, with the intention of pursuing an internal transfer later if successful in their studies. General advice for selecting a backup major suggests choosing one within a different college or a less impacted STEM field (like math or a related science) if aiming for a competitive engineering program.; internal_transfer_difficulty: Internal transfer for majors, particularly within engineering and science departments at Missouri S&T, can be competitive. While the term 'impacted majors' isn't explicitly used, these departments generally reserve the right to enforce more stringent cumulative GPA requirements for internal transfer applications than the university's general minimum. Undergraduate students wishing to change majors must submit an application with the Office of the Registrar, and the receiving department must approve the change, often placing academic conditions upon the application. Consulting with an academic advisor is essential to understand how a major change might impact academic progress, course requirements, and graduation timeline."
