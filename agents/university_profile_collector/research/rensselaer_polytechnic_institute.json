While the academic rigor is high, students often find a cooperative atmosphere and opportunities for social engagement in Troy's local restaurants and bars.",
      "transportation_impact": "The campus provides a shuttle service for safe transportation around campus, requiring a Rensselaer ID. During university breaks (Thanksgiving, Winter, Spring), RPI offers holiday transportation to the Albany Amtrak station, Albany bus terminal, and Albany International Airport, which significantly aids students traveling to and from campus. Weather conditions can impact shuttle operations.",
      "research_impact": "Research is a cornerstone of the RPI experience, with undergraduates encouraged to participate from their first day. Opportunities include the Undergraduate Research Program (URP) for academic credit or paid assistantships, as well as full-time summer research awards. Graduate students make significant contributions, working closely with faculty mentors and securing prestigious fellowships. RPI attracts substantial research funding (approximately $103 million annually) and boasts numerous research centers focused on areas like biotechnology, computational innovations, materials science, and infrastructure/transportation, fostering strong industry and government ties."
