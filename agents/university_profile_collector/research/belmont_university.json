One approach is to apply as \"Undeclared,\" allowing the flexibility to explore various academic areas during the first two years before formally declaring a major. Alternatively, students can apply with a major they are seriously considering, even if it's not their most competitive choice, with the understanding that they can change it later if it proves not to be the right fit. However, it is crucial to note that certain highly competitive programs, such as Nursing, Songwriting, and Music, require a separate application process for admission, even for current students wishing to change into those majors.; internal_transfer_difficulty: Internal transfer into highly competitive or \"impacted\" programs at Belmont University, specifically Nursing, Songwriting, and Music (including minors), involves a competitive process. Current students wishing to switch to these programs must submit a separate application for admission to the respective academic department, rather than merely submitting a change of major form. This indicates a more rigorous selection process for these particular fields of study."
