Architecture is one of the majors that encourages early declaration. For students who are undecided, academic advisors are available to discuss major possibilities during the first semester. While there isn't an explicit 'backup major' selection on the initial application like listing a specific alternate major outside of your primary interest, the system allows for entry into a broader college (e.g., College of Engineering) before specializing, or starting as undeclared within a college and then declaring a specific major later.

Transfer admission in general may be less competitive for those with 24 or more transferable college credits and a 2.0 cumulative GPA, but specific honors programs, such as within the Walton College of Business, can be competitive for transfer students.

Architecture is one of the majors that encourages early declaration. For students who are undecided, academic advisors are available to discuss major possibilities during the first semester. While there isn't an explicit 'backup major' selection on the initial application like listing a specific alternate major outside of your primary interest, the system allows for entry into a broader college (e.g., College of Engineering) before specializing, or starting as undeclared within a college and then declaring a specific major later.

Transfer admission in general may be less competitive for those with 24 or more transferable college credits and a 2.0 cumulative GPA, but specific honors programs, such as within the Walton College of Business, can be competitive for transfer students.
