All halls require keycard access for safety and provide community kitchens (though meal plans are mandatory for first-year students). Newer facilities like Spruce Hall feature modern amenities such as in-room thermostats, ample study and social spaces, private showers in gender-inclusive bathrooms, and sometimes an attached gym or restaurant. Traditional halls (e.g., Bradford, Morgan, Randall, Thomas) are known for fostering a strong, tight-knit community, partly due to their communal living setup. Elm Hall offers a community-style environment with shared kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry facilities. Maple Hall provides suite-style living with two rooms sharing a single bathroom. Theme Learning Communities are also available for first-year residents to connect students with similar interests. An 800-bed residence hall for sophomores, Residence Hall VII, is set to open in Fall 2026, offering dining, recreation, wellness, and study areas.",
      "student_archetype": "Colorado School of Mines attracts ambitious and dedicated students, often described as 'problem-solvers' and 'nerds,' who thrive in a highly rigorous academic environment focused on engineering, applied science, and mathematics. These students are serious about their education, committed to hard work, and often engaged in internships and job placements before graduation. There's a strong sense of community and solidarity among students, viewing the challenging curriculum as a 'team sport'. Many Orediggers also embrace the outdoors, taking advantage of Golden's opportunities for climbing, hiking, and skiing. They are typically academically focused, critical thinkers, and aspire to be civically-engaged leaders."
