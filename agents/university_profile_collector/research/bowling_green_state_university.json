A free BGSU Shuttle Service provides transportation around campus and to nearby areas like downtown and the university airport, with recent upgrades including new buses, bike racks, and a real-time tracking app. While public transportation within Bowling Green is available, it is limited, making walking, biking, or the university shuttle the primary modes of on-campus travel for many students. For off-campus travel, ride-sharing services or personal vehicles are common, and the local B.G. Transit public bus service operates throughout the city.",
      "research_impact": "Bowling Green State University offers strong undergraduate research opportunities across various disciplines. The Center for Undergraduate Research and Scholarship (CURS) actively helps students, from their first year onwards, find and engage in innovative research, scholarly, and creative projects with faculty mentors. Students can receive funding for research supplies and stipends for summer research fellowships, such as the 10-week experience offered by the Department of Chemistry. These opportunities allow students to work with faculty on independent projects, often alongside graduate students, gaining valuable experience for future careers or graduate studies. Departments like Developmental Psychology recruit undergraduate research assistants to participate in various research aspects, including literature searches and data entry, enabling students to develop critical skills, deepen their knowledge, strengthen their resumes, and build professional relationships. Students can also earn course credit for their involvement as research assistants."

The specific credit awarded varies by subject, with scores of 3 often receiving 3 credits towards an elective or specific course, and scores of 4 or 5 frequently earning more specific course equivalencies, often fulfilling General Studies requirements or more advanced courses. For example, a score of 3 on Calculus AB receives MATH 1220 (4 credits), while a score of 4 or 5 receives MATH 1260 (5 credits). Many exams, like Computer Science A, award 3 credits for any score of 3, 4, or 5.",

Similar to AP, the specific credit awarded depends on the subject and score. A score of 4 on a Higher Level exam can often earn 3 credits, while higher scores (5-7) can lead to more substantial credit, sometimes fulfilling multiple courses or General Studies requirements. For instance, a Biology HL score of 4 yields BIOL 1040 (3 credits), a score of 5 yields BIOL 2010 (3 credits), and scores of 6 or 7 yield BIOL 2010 & 2020 (6 credits).",

      "To get into Bowling Green State University, prospective students should focus on several key success factors, as highlighted by student perspectives and admissions information:",
      "Strong Academic Record with Challenging Coursework: A solid high school GPA, ideally 3.0 or higher, is crucial, with the average admitted student having a GPA around 3.41 to 3.5. Taking challenging courses, such as AP or honors classes, significantly enhances an applicant's profile and demonstrates readiness for college-level work.",
      "Demonstrated Passion and Engagement in Extracurricular Activities: While specific activities aren't detailed, a \"well-rounded application\" that includes \"extracurricular involvement\" is considered important. This suggests that actively participating in meaningful activities outside of academics can help an applicant stand out.",
      "Authentic and Thoughtful Personal Statement/Essays: Applicants are encouraged to submit a personal statement that thoughtfully highlights their unique journey, experiences, and future aspirations. This provides valuable insight into an applicant's character and commitment.",
      "Possession of Drive and Determination (Grit): A quality often associated with successful BGSU students is \"grit,\" which encompasses the drive and determination to succeed and accomplish goals. Demonstrating this quality can be an \"X factor\" in an application."

      "Low High School GPA: Bowling Green State University generally admits students with an average GPA of around 3.7. A GPA significantly below this average could be a red flag, as a strong academic record is a crucial aspect of your application.",
      "Lack of Meaningful Extracurricular Activities: BGSU values applicants who are involved in extracurricular activities, such as school clubs, community service, or other passions. An application that shows no depth or impact in activities outside of academics may not stand out.",
      "Generic or Poorly Written Essay (if submitted): While not always required, submitting a personal essay is an opportunity to showcase your personality, interests, and ability to reflect on experiences. A generic essay that could apply to any university or one that is poorly written will likely not strengthen your application.",
      "Incomplete Application or Missing Required Documents: Failing to submit all necessary materials, such as official high school transcripts or the application form itself, will cause significant delays and likely lead to your application not being considered.",
      "Not Meeting Specific Program Requirements: Certain majors at BGSU may have additional admission requirements, such as supplementary essay questions for programs like Aviation Studies. Failing to fulfill these specific program prerequisites can hinder your admission to those particular areas of study."

The Center for Undergraduate Research and Scholarship (CURS) actively helps students, from their first year onwards, find and engage in innovative research, scholarly, and creative projects with faculty mentors. Students can receive funding for research supplies and stipends for summer research fellowships, such as the 10-week experience offered by the Department of Chemistry. These opportunities allow students to work with faculty on independent projects, often alongside graduate students, gaining valuable experience for future careers or graduate studies. Departments like Developmental Psychology recruit undergraduate research assistants to participate in various research aspects, including literature searches and data entry, enabling students to develop critical skills, deepen their knowledge, strengthen their resumes, and build professional relationships. Students can also earn course credit for their involvement as research assistants."
