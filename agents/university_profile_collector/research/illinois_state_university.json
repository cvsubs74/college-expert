    "alternate_major_strategy": "For highly competitive majors, it may not be possible to gain admission for all qualified applicants. If a preferred major has space limitations or specific prerequisites are not met, transfer students may be admitted to the university as 'undeclared'. This implies that if an applicant's first-choice major is highly impacted, they might consider applying for a less competitive major or be prepared for the possibility of starting as undeclared. Students with 75 or more completed semester hours will not be admitted as undeclared. The concept of a 'backup major' during the initial admission process is not explicitly detailed in the provided search results as a distinct application field. However, the university's policy for transfer students suggests an indirect approach: if a transfer student's preferred major is full or they don't meet its prerequisites, they might still be admitted to the university as undeclared, provided they meet general university admission requirements (e.g., a minimum 2.0 GPA). This could serve as an implicit backup, allowing students to later pursue their desired major once enrolled, subject to internal transfer policies. Illinois State University provides a structured process for current students to change their major. This can occur for various reasons, including denial of admission to an intended major, being dropped from a current major, or simply discovering a better fit. Key aspects of changing a major after admission include: 'Plan a Major Change' Tool, 'What-If Report', Application Process (typically during specific windows: February 1–29 and September 1–30), Considerations (not practical for juniors/seniors, 75 Hour Policy, Truth in Tuition, limited space, departments blocking courses), and Academic Advising. International students also have their SEVIS record updated automatically upon major change."

      "Strong Academic Record: Admitted students generally have an average GPA, and competitive SAT/ACT scores, indicating that a solid academic foundation is crucial. For instance, the average GPA of admitted transfer students is 3.6, and admitted students have SAT scores between 1010-1230 or ACT scores between 22-27.",
      "Engagement in Opportunities: While not explicitly tied to admission, students discuss how ISU provides 'the tools for success as an educator' and how 'extracurricular activities give balance to college students' lives when they take advantage of the opportunities.' This suggests that demonstrating an eagerness to engage and make the most of available resources and opportunities, even before attending, could be valued. One student mentioned getting involved in research in their first year.",
      "Demonstrated Interests and Fit: Students choosing ISU often cite specific program options and the desire to explore their interests. This implies that applicants who can articulate their interests and how ISU's programs align with their goals might present a strong case.",
      "Personal Qualities and Growth Potential: Testimonials mention instructors who 'saw potential in me I didn't know I had' and how ISU 'has given me the chance to pursue that goal.' This hints that showing personal growth, potential, and a proactive attitude towards one's education and future could be implicit success factors."
