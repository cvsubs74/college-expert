    "executive_summary": "Washington State University (WSU) is a public research university located in Pullman, Washington. Established in 1890, it is the state's original land-grant university, focusing on practical education, research, and outreach. WSU offers a wide array of undergraduate and graduate programs, with notable strengths in agriculture, veterinary medicine, engineering, and hospitality business management. It is characterized by a vibrant campus life and a strong sense of community, particularly in its relatively isolated rural setting.",
    "market_position": "A comprehensive public research university, known for its strong agricultural and veterinary medicine programs, and its land-grant mission. It serves a broad range of students, particularly those from Washington state, and maintains a strong regional identity.",
    "admissions_philosophy": "WSU seeks to admit a diverse cohort of students who demonstrate academic promise, a willingness to engage in a residential campus experience, and a potential to contribute to the university's research and community-oriented mission. Holistic review considers GPA, coursework rigor, test scores (optional), essays, and extracurricular involvement, with anS an emphasis on students who align with the land-grant values of service and innovation.",

      "social_environment": "Known for a strong residential campus culture and a vibrant Greek life. The relatively isolated location fosters a close-knit community with many campus-centered social events, sports (NCAA Division I Pac-12), and student organizations. Pullman itself is a college town, heavily influenced by the university.",
      "transportation_impact": "Pullman is somewhat isolated, requiring travel by car or regional airport (Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport) for many students. On-campus transportation is primarily walking or a robust bus system. For students living off-campus in Pullman, walking or biking is common. The remoteness means students often stay on campus or in town during weekends.",
      "research_impact": "As an R1 research institution, WSU has a significant research footprint, particularly in agriculture, plant sciences, veterinary medicine, clean energy, and materials science. Students, both undergraduate and graduate, have numerous opportunities to engage in cutting-edge research through various labs, institutes, and faculty mentorship programs, contributing to the university's land-grant mission."

Many programs, particularly in competitive fields like Computer Science, Engineering, and Nursing, have secondary admission criteria. These often include completing specific prerequisite courses, achieving a certain cumulative GPA, or even a higher GPA in particular foundational courses, and submitting a separate \"request for admission\" or \"declaration of intent\" to the department. Prioritize understanding these requirements for your desired major.",
      "Consider Applying as \"Undecided/Exploring\": If you are unsure about your major, or if your top-choice major is highly competitive, applying as \"Undecided/Exploring\" is a viable and often recommended strategy at WSU. This approach does not negatively impact your initial chances of university admission. It provides an opportunity to fulfill general education requirements (UCORE) and prerequisite courses for various majors during your first year or two, allowing you to explore different fields and make an informed decision by your second year. WSU offers resources like the Academic Success and Career Center (ASCC) and a \"College Majors and Career Exploration\" course (UNIV 100) to assist undecided students.",
      "Strategically Plan Coursework to Meet Major Prerequisites: For students with a clear target major that has specific internal admission requirements, plan your initial coursework strategically. Focus on completing any necessary math, science, or introductory courses with the required grades as outlined by your prospective department. This ensures you are on track to meet the criteria for admission to your chosen major once you are eligible to apply internally.",
      "Explore Less Directly Competitive Majors: While popular majors like Psychology, Nursing, Biology, Marketing, and Computer Science attract many students, if you are not set on a highly competitive program, consider exploring majors within the humanities, social sciences, or broader arts and sciences. These fields often have more straightforward internal admission processes, sometimes only requiring a declaration of intent or meeting a general university GPA standard, rather than extensive course prerequisites or a competitive application process for limited spots."

Applying as 'undecided' or 'deciding/exploring' is a viable option and does not negatively impact admission chances, allowing students time to explore interests through University Common Requirements (UCORE) courses. For certain competitive programs, like those within the School of Design and Construction (Architecture, Interior Design, Landscape Architecture, Construction Management), admission to the major is a separate, competitive process that occurs after completing pre-professional coursework, and meeting minimum requirements does not guarantee acceptance due to enrollment limits. While not explicitly stated as an official 'strategy,' if applying to one of these highly competitive, capacity-limited majors, considering an alternate major, perhaps in a different college, could be a practical approach.
