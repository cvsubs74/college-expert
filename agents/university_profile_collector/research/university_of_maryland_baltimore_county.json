    "alternate_major_strategy": "alternate_major_strategy: When applying to UMBC, students can designate any major. For highly competitive majors such as Computer Science and Engineering, freshmen applicants declaring these interests are typically admitted to the University as a 'Pre-Major' (e.g., Pre-Computer Science or Pre-Mechanical Engineering). Full acceptance into these specific majors occurs after meeting designated 'Gateway requirements' and successfully completing at least one semester at UMBC, generally within the first two years of enrollment. While not explicitly stated as a 'backup major' strategy during initial application to increase overall university admission chances, applicants interested in highly competitive fields should be aware of the pre-major phase and the subsequent requirements for full major admission. For those uncertain about their major, UMBC offers resources like the Office for Academic and Pre-Professional Advising to help explore options.; internal_transfer_difficulty: Changing majors after admission at UMBC is a common process, facilitated by completing a form through the Registrar's Office. Students can change their major multiple times. Some majors may require an advisor's signature for the change. However, for impacted or highly competitive majors, such as Computer Science and Engineering, the internal transfer process is competitive. Students initially admitted as 'Pre-Majors' must meet specific 'Gateway requirements' to be fully admitted into these programs. For Computer Science, specifically, the internal transfer process is described as very competitive, with only about 100 spots available per year for both internal and external transfers."
