Transfer credit generally requires a grade of C- or better. Post-matriculation transfer credit (after enrolling at GW) is limited to 9-12 credits and typically does not apply toward general education requirements. Mathematics courses below the Calculus level will not transfer. GW does not use ASSIST.org as its direct transfer articulation system; ASSIST.org is for transfers between California public institutions."
