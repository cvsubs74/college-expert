    "campus_dynamics": {
      "social_environment": "The social environment at Tufts is described as a 'small school atmosphere' within a medium-sized liberal arts university. Students are generally friendly, open-minded, and intellectually curious. While some past discussions mention a tougher social scene, more recent accounts suggest a vibrant social life if students actively seek it out, with parties hosted by sports houses, clubs, and Greek life. The proximity to Davis Square and Boston also provides numerous off-campus social opportunities and access to concerts and cultural events.",
      "transportation_impact": "Tufts' Medford/Somerville campus is well-connected by the MBTA subway (Red Line and Green Line E), bus system, and commuter rail, making it easily accessible from the greater Boston area. The university also provides campus shuttles, a grocery store shuttle, SafeRide services for late-night transportation, and partnerships with Zipcar and Lyft. This robust transportation network allows students to easily navigate between campuses (Medford/Somerville, Boston) and explore the city without relying heavily on personal vehicles.",
      "research_impact": "Tufts is a distinguished research university with a very high level of research activity (R1 classification). It offers a wide array of research opportunities for all students, including undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars, across its various schools and departments. Students can engage in groundbreaking discovery and innovation, often working alongside professors on projects that apply scientific work and academic knowledge to real-world challenges. Specific programs like Summer Scholars, the Visiting and Early Research Scholar Experience (VERSE), and the Global Research Assistant Program (GRAP) further enhance these opportunities, including international research projects."
