      "Resilience in the face of challenges, particularly those that contextualize academic achievement",

    "insights": [
      "The college system (e.g., Muir vs. Revelle) drastically changes your GE workload; Muir is famously easier while Revelle is rigorous",
      "The 'UC Socially Dead' reputation is largely a myth; social life exists but requires active effort and joining clubs",
      "Proximity to Black's Beach and La Jolla Shores is a major perk for students seeking a relaxed coastal environment",
      "Admissions are 'major-blind' for the university itself, but getting into 'capped' majors (CS, Engineering) is significantly harder",
      "The quarter system moves extremely fast; students recommend 'locking in' from week 1 to avoid falling behind"
