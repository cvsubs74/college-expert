    "alternate_major_strategy": "UC Merced considers alternate majors for admission. If an applicant is not admitted to their first-choice major, they may be admitted to an alternate if they meet its selection criteria. It is often recommended to list a less competitive major as an alternate if the primary major is highly selective (e.g., Computer Science as primary, Applied Math as alternate) to increase chances of campus admission. If the goal is solely to pursue a highly selective major, listing it as both primary and alternate is an option, but be aware that non-admission to that major could mean no admission to the university. While the UC application allows for alternate majors within the same school, some advice suggests choosing majors from different schools.",
    "internal_transfer_difficulty": "Changing majors at UC Merced is possible but comes with limitations and varying levels of difficulty depending on the desired major and school. Students are expected to declare a major by 60 units and are generally not permitted to change majors after reaching 90 units (senior standing) or in the semester they've filed to graduate. First-semester freshmen and transfer students typically cannot change majors until after their first term. Admission to a new major can be denied if a student is in academic difficulty or has a GPA below 2.0 in courses required for that major. Specific schools and majors have additional, more stringent criteria. For instance, internal transfers into highly selective majors within the School of Engineering (like Computer Science) are described as 'very rare' and require 'very high grades and prerequisites' and a proposed graduation plan within 10 semesters. Transfer students seeking to enter an Engineering major must meet the original admission criteria for that major. Similarly, the School of Social Sciences, Humanities, and Arts (SSHA) requires students to be in good academic standing and complete the change before 90 units; transfer students generally must have met major-specific transfer criteria upon admission to declare an SSHA major after matriculation. Students are encouraged to consult with advisors early due to course sequencing and school-specific requirements."
