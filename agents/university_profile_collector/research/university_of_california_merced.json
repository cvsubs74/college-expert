There are over 200 student clubs and organizations, Greek life, and a wide array of campus events including movie nights, concerts, cultural events, and the annual 'Cowchella' music festival. While some perceive the surrounding town to have limited entertainment, the campus actively hosts diverse activities, and students often take advantage of weekend trips to nearby attractions like Yosemite National Park, San Francisco, or Modesto.",
      "transportation_impact": "The university provides its own bus service, CatTracks, offering free transportation for students, staff, and faculty to and from campus and nearby areas. Additionally, UC Merced students have free access to Merced's city bus system ('The Bus'), including a dedicated 'Route UC' to campus, by using their CatCard. Alternative transportation options like bike paths, carpooling, and ZipCar rentals are also available. This robust transportation network aims to reduce reliance on personal vehicles and connects the somewhat rural campus to the wider Merced community, enhancing accessibility for commuters and allowing on-campus students to explore the city.",
      "research_impact": "As the first American research university established in the 21st century and an R1-classified institution (very high research activity), UC Merced places a strong emphasis on discovery and innovation. Undergraduate students have extensive opportunities to engage in faculty-mentored research projects through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center (UROC). Research spans various disciplines, focusing on creating new products and technologies, addressing societal issues like disease and global warming, and incorporating scientific data and methods into philosophical arguments. The university fosters interdisciplinary research through various institutes and centers, allowing students to contribute to cutting-edge projects with far-reaching impact."
