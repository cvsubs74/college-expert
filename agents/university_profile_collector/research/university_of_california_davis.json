There are over 800 registered student organizations, including a thriving athletics program with Division I teams supported by the large student-run spirit organization, the Aggie Pack. While Greek life is present (over 10% of undergraduates), it is not central to the social scene, allowing for diverse social opportunities. The surrounding city of Davis, a vibrant college town, contributes to the social environment with farmer's markets, music festivals, and a downtown area with bars and restaurants within walking or biking distance.",
      "transportation_impact": "Transportation significantly shapes campus life due to Davis's bike-friendly infrastructure, featuring over 95 miles of bike paths. The Unitrans bus system provides convenient routes throughout Davis, and Yolobus or Amtrak's Capital Corridor offer connections to major destinations across the state, including Sacramento and the Bay Area. On-campus transportation services, including Safe Ride for night travel, enhance accessibility and safety. The emphasis on biking and public transit promotes an environmentally conscious and active campus community.",
      "research_impact": "As an R1 (Research 1) institution, UC Davis places a strong emphasis on research, offering extensive opportunities for undergraduates to engage in hands-on research through internships, faculty mentorship, and at facilities like the UC Davis Medical Center or local industry. Students can co-author papers, publish in the undergraduate journal 'Explorations,' and present at the annual Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activities Conference. The university's research strengths are particularly notable in agriculture, environmental sciences, and biological fields, with over $1 billion in research funding and top-ranked programs in veterinary medicine and agriculture."
