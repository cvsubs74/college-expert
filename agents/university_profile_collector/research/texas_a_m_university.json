Admissions committees want to \"feel like they\'re experiencing the life event with you.\" This approach allows the reader to understand your character through your actions and experiences rather than simply being told about them.",
      "Be Authentic and Personal: Texas A&M is looking for unique, creative, and ambitious students. Your essays are an opportunity to reveal who you are beyond your grades and test scores, showcasing your journey, aspirations, and how you would contribute to the Aggie community. Avoid clichés and overused phrases to ensure your essay stands out and reflects your genuine self.",
      "Connect Your Experiences to College Readiness and Future Goals: When describing life events, challenges, or influential people, explicitly explain how these experiences have prepared you for success in college. For major-specific essays, articulate your motivation for choosing the major, what sparked your interest, and how it aligns with your future professional career goals. If applicable, mention specific resources, organizations, or classes at Texas A&M that align with your ambitions.",
      "Focus on the \"Why\" and Your Reflection: For essays about opportunities, challenges, or impactful individuals, don\'t just recount the events. Expand on *why* these experiences mattered to you and how they shaped who you are today. The reflection on your narrative is what makes your essay unique and helps the reader understand your growth and change.",
      "Start Early and Brainstorm Thoroughly: Given that Texas A&M typically requires multiple supplemental essays, starting early allows ample time for brainstorming and drafting. Brainstorming helps you identify the most impactful opportunities and challenges from your high school career and to consider what character traits you want your essays to convey. This preparation is crucial for crafting thoughtful and effective responses."

      "Show, Don\'t Tell, with Vivid, Specific Details: Instead of broadly stating a quality or experience, illustrate it with concrete examples and descriptive language. Admissions committees want to \"feel like they\'re experiencing the life event with you.\" This approach allows the reader to understand your character through your actions and experiences rather than simply being told about them.",
      "Be Authentic and Personal: Texas A&M is looking for unique, creative, and ambitious students. Your essays are an opportunity to reveal who you are beyond your grades and test scores, showcasing your journey, aspirations, and how you would contribute to the Aggie community. Avoid clichés and overused phrases to ensure your essay stands out and reflects your genuine self.",
      "Connect Your Experiences to College Readiness and Future Goals: When describing life events, challenges, or influential people, explicitly explain how these experiences have prepared you for success in college. For major-specific essays, articulate your motivation for choosing the major, what sparked your interest, and how it aligns with your future professional career goals. If applicable, mention specific resources, organizations, or classes at Texas A&M that align with your ambitions.",
      "Focus on the \"Why\" and Your Reflection: For essays about opportunities, challenges, or impactful individuals, don\'t just recount the events. Expand on *why* these experiences mattered to you and how they shaped who you are today. The reflection on your narrative is what makes your essay unique and helps the reader understand your growth and change.",
      "Start Early and Brainstorm Thoroughly: Given that Texas A&M typically requires multiple supplemental essays, starting early allows ample time for brainstorming and drafting. Brainstorming helps you identify the most impactful opportunities and challenges from your high school career and to consider what character traits you want your essays to convey. This preparation is crucial for crafting thoughtful and effective responses."
