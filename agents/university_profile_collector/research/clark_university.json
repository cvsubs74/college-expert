For instance, Dana Hall is noted as an older building without an elevator, which can get hot, though some reviews suggest it has less 'drama' compared to other halls. Johnson Sanford Center (JSC) is a larger upperclassmen hall with recently renovated study rooms and lounges, offering traditional dorm rooms (singles, doubles, and some triples), and also includes 8-person suites. Dodd Hall is an all-women's dorm with kitchens, and Maywood Hall is popular among sophomores, though residents typically still require a full meal plan and it has only one communal kitchen. Clark also provides convenient, move-in ready housing for graduate students, which includes Wi-Fi and furniture. The university's Facilities Management department is committed to maintaining a safe, clean, and attractive living environment.",

The student body is diverse, with a notable presence of out-of-state students and a percentage of international students. Students are often described as friendly, thoughtful, and engaged in a wide array of over 130 clubs and organizations, conducting research, and even starting their own businesses. Academics are prioritized, with professors who are supportive and eager to help students succeed, emphasizing real-world application and hands-on learning. There's a balance between competitive athletics (NCAA Division III) and academic commitments, along with strong support for health and well-being. Important student issues often include politics and the environment.",
        "strategic_fit_advice": "Prospective students who thrive in a close-knit, welcoming community with a strong emphasis on academic engagement, research opportunities, and social responsibility would find Clark University to be a good fit. Those who appreciate professors who know their name and provide individualized support, and who are eager to participate in a diverse range of extracurricular activities and community involvement, should consider applying. Applicants should be prepared for a campus that encourages critical thinking, entrepreneurial spirit, and a desire to challenge convention and enact positive change. While living in an urban setting in Worcester, students also have access to study abroad programs and consortium courses with other local universities like WPI or Holy Cross."

While these fields attract many applicants, demonstrating genuine passion and strong academic performance in your chosen area, even if it's a popular one, is crucial. Clark emphasizes a holistic review process, looking for \"curiosity and the drive to make a difference\" and valuing how applicants have challenged themselves and shown growth.",
      "Leverage the Test-Optional Policy by Focusing on a Strong Transcript and Holistic Profile: Clark University has been test-optional since 2012 and emphasizes that standardized test scores do not fully represent most students. Instead, they look at your high school GPA (average unweighted GPA for admitted students is 3.69), challenging coursework, and involvement in extracurricular activities, family commitments, and part-time jobs. Your chosen major should be supported by a strong academic record in relevant subjects.",
      "Consider Applying to Less Subscribed Majors if Not Fully Set on a Highly Competitive Field, but Prioritize Genuine Interest: While the data doesn't explicitly state \"easier majors to get into,\" majors with fewer graduates might have less competition. However, this should not override genuine interest. Clark offers a wide array of majors, and exploring less common fields where you have a strong, authentic interest could allow your unique profile to stand out. For example, while Psychology graduates 100 students, other majors like Comparative Literature (1 graduate), Criminal Justice/Safety Studies (3 graduates), or Computational and Applied Mathematics (4 graduates) have significantly fewer.",
      "Utilize Early Decision if Clark is Your Top Choice and You Have a Strong Major Preference: Clark offers Early Decision I and II, which are binding agreements, and have a higher acceptance rate (e.g., Early Decision Acceptance Rate of 73% compared to an overall 42-49%). If you are certain about attending Clark and have a clear major in mind, applying Early Decision could significantly increase your chances of admission."

Undergraduate admissions are centralized, and all students adhere to a core liberal arts curriculum.\n\nTherefore, strategies for ranking *colleges* within a larger university system are not applicable to Clark University."

    "alternate_major_strategy": "Clark University is a private research university located in Worcester, Massachusetts, United States. Founded in 1887 by prominent businessman Jonas Gilman Clark, it was originally established as one of the first all-graduate institutions in the country. The university later admitted its first undergraduates in 1902 and began enrolling women in 1942.\n\nAcademics and Programs:\nClark University offers a rigorous liberal arts curriculum within a research-intensive environment. The university provides 46 undergraduate majors, minors, and interdisciplinary concentrations, and 34 graduate majors. Students also have the option to design specialized majors and pursue pre-professional programs. Popular undergraduate majors, based on 2021 graduates, include Psychology, Economics, Political Science and Government, Business Administration and Management, and Biology/Biological Sciences. New majors offered include interactive media/game design (ranked #3 in the world by The Princeton Review), marketing, data science, finance, and mathematics education. Clark has a student-faculty ratio of 9:1, and 94% of its faculty hold doctoral or terminal degrees. One-third of Clark students go on to earn their master's degree through a tuition-free Accelerated B.A./Master's program.\n\nRankings and Recognition:\nClark University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education. In the QS World University Rankings 2026, Clark was ranked #1001-1200. U.S. News & World Report placed Clark University at No. 142 in its 2024 rankings of national universities. The Princeton Review has recognized Clark for its Game Design programs (ranked #2 Top Northeast Game Design: Ugrad, and #3 Top 50 Game Design: Ugrad), as well as being LGBTQ-Friendly (#16) and a Top 20 Best School for Making an Impact (Private Schools) (#16). Clark is also noted for its undergraduate research opportunities and for being a \"Best Value School\".\n\nCampus and Student Life:\nClark University's campus is situated on 72 acres in an urban setting in Worcester, Massachusetts. Worcester is New England's second-largest city and a hub for biotech, higher education, healthcare, and the arts. The university's student body comprises approximately 2,203 undergraduates and 1,356 graduate students. The majority of undergraduate students, 66%, live on campus in a variety of housing options including traditional residence halls and houses.\n\nClark fosters a creative, intellectually daring, and playful community with over 130 student clubs and organizations. Students are actively engaged in groundbreaking research and entrepreneurial ventures, such as the Clark Tank competition. Clark is an NCAA Division III school and competes in 17 varsity sports as the Clark Cougars. Students can also participate in intramural and club sports, with over half of all \"Clarkies\" involved in athletics and recreation. Through the Higher Education Consortium of Central Massachusetts, Clark students can cross-register for courses at other local institutions like Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the College of the Holy Cross.\n\nNotable Alumni:\nClark University boasts a distinguished list of alumni who have made significant contributions across various fields. Some notable alumni include:\n*   Robert H. Goddard: A pioneering rocket scientist who conducted many experiments on campus and is credited with creating and building the world's first liquid-fueled rocket.\n*   Francis Sumner: The first African-American to receive a Ph.D. in psychology, often referred to as the \"father of black psychology\".\n*   Edward Bradford Titchener: An English psychologist known for creating structuralism.\n*   Paul Siple: An Antarctic explorer and inventor of the wind chill factor, who named a mountain range in Antarctica after Clark University.\n*   Padma Lakshmi: Emmy-nominated host and executive producer of Bravo's Top Chef.\n*   Jeffrey Lurie: Billionaire owner of the Philadelphia Eagles.\n*   Marc Lasry: Billionaire CEO and co-founder of Avenue Capital Group.\n*   Sonia Gardner: Co-founder of Avenue Capital Group.\n*   William Leonard Langer: American historian and chairman of the history department at Harvard University.\n*   Li Ji (Li Chi): Influential Chinese archaeologist instrumental in proving the historical authenticity of the Shang dynasty."

Avoid generic statements about \"strong academics\" or \"low student-to-faculty ratios.\" Instead, demonstrate a deep understanding of Clark by mentioning specific resources, departments, research opportunities, or campus communities that genuinely resonate with your interests and aspirations.",
      "Show, don't tell, by using concrete examples. Rather than simply stating your qualities (e.g., \"I am a leader\"), illustrate them through specific stories and actions. Provide detailed examples of your involvement in extracurricular activities or work experiences, highlighting your contributions, challenges, and successes.",
      "Connect your experiences and values to the Clark community. Clark emphasizes being a \"kind, welcoming, engaged, and inclusive community\" and a \"force for change.\" Your essays should demonstrate how your past experiences, particularly in community involvement or making a positive impact, align with these values and how you envision contributing specifically to the Clark community.",
      "Avoid clichés and generic topics, or offer a unique perspective on a common theme. Admissions officers read countless essays. Steer clear of overused narratives like winning a big sports game or a typical mission trip. If you choose a common topic, focus on a unique moment or a fresh perspective that reveals something distinct about your personality, values, or growth."
