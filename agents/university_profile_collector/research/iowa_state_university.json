Bring a printed copy of your alternate degree audit to this meeting.\", \"Formal Process (Forms): The specific forms and steps depend on whether the change is within the same college or between different colleges. Generally, this involves forms like the 'LAS Change of Major' (for within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences) or a 'File Transmittal Form' (for changes within the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences or between different colleges). These forms typically require signatures and coordination with student services offices in both the current and new departments/colleges.\"], 'international_students': \"International students changing their major or adding a second major/minor do not need to complete a 'Change to Academic Program' form. Instead, they should email the International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO) to request an updated I-20.\"}; admission_process_note: Iowa State University operates on a rolling admissions basis, meaning applications are evaluated as they are received.
