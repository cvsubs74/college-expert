      "Reflect on Your Experiences and Growth: When discussing an experience, accomplishment, or challenge, clearly articulate what you did, why it was important to you, and what you learned from it. Colleges want to understand how you've grown and what these experiences reveal about your character and potential.",
      "Connect Your Interests to the University's Mission (if applicable): While not a specific prompt found in the search, for a Catholic university, considering how your values, academic interests, or personal goals align with CUA's mission as a faith-based institution can strengthen your essay, especially if you choose to write about a topic that allows for such a connection."
