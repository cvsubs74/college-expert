    "alternate_major_strategy": "When applying to Virginia Tech, if your first-choice major is highly competitive (e.g., Computer Science or a specific engineering field), list a backup major that is either in a different college or a less competitive field. For example, if applying to CS in the College of Engineering, consider listing a related but less competitive major in the College of Science (like Computational Modeling and Data Analytics (CMDA) or Statistics) or a completely different field like Cognitive Science or a humanities major in the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences. Note that some universities, like Virginia Tech, have specific GPA requirements and prerequisites for internal major transfers, especially into restricted programs like engineering."
