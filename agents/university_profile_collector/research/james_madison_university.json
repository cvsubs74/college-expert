        "category": "Selectivity",
        "insight": "James Madison University is a moderately selective institution with an acceptance rate typically around 72-76%. While test-optional, a strong academic record and rigorous coursework are key for admission.",
        "implication": "Applicants should prioritize achieving a strong GPA in challenging high school courses.
