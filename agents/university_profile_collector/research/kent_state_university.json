When applying, students are asked if they want their test scores to be considered; if yes, the application is reviewed with scores and other requirements. If no, the application is reviewed once all other requirements are fulfilled. This decision cannot be changed online once indicated. Test scores are considered if submitted, but not required for admission. For first-year students, a holistic approach to admissions is used, evaluating applicants based on high school GPA, standardized test scores (if submitted), and college preparatory curriculum. A minimum GPA of 2.7 on a 4.0 scale with an ACT composite of 22 or an SAT score of 1100 is considered, though scores are not required for admission.",

      "restrictions": "Transfer credit will be accepted for college-level courses from institutionally accredited or international equivalent institutions. Grade requirements vary by institution type and date: Ohio institutions require a minimum D grade (Fall 2005 or later) or C grade (prior to Fall 2005); out-of-Ohio and international institutions require a minimum D grade (Fall 2010 or later) or C grade (prior to Fall 2010). Some majors may require higher grades. Transfer credits count toward total credit hours for graduation but not Kent State GPA or residence requirements. A maximum of 12 graduate credit hours may be transferred. For undergraduate bachelor's degrees, a minimum of 30 'passed hours in residence' (including 9 upper-division major hours) must be completed at Kent State University. For associate degrees, a minimum of 15 'passed hours in residence' is required. Completion of the Ohio Transfer 36 (36-40 semester hours) satisfies general education requirements. The 60 semester hour benchmark is related to competitive admission eligibility for students without an associate's degree or for general education fulfillment, not an overall cap on accepted undergraduate transfer credits."
