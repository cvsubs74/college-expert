For those who do submit test scores, either SAT or ACT scores are acceptable, and neither the writing section nor SAT Subject Tests are required. Test results from any of the student's high school years are acceptable. WashU accepts self-reported scores on the Common and Coalition applications. If a student enrolls at WashU and submitted unofficial scores, official score reports from testing agencies will then be required. For the ACT, WashU considers the highest section scores across all the test dates submitted. If a student takes both the ACT and SAT, WashU will consider whichever set of scores is most advantageous. WashU will 'Super Score' ACT or SAT scores and consider the highest section scores across all test dates submitted (individual section retakes are accepted on the ACT). The last test date accepted will be the December testing (October if applying Early Decision I).",

Washington University in St. Louis encourages applicants to select one of the academic divisions (Architecture, Art, Arts & Sciences, Business, or Engineering) based on their primary interests. While an intended major is indicated during the application, formal declaration often doesn't occur until the second year. WashU emphasizes a holistic review process and states that all undergraduate schools generally have similar admissions criteria.",
      "Consider that popular majors like Computer Science, Finance, and Engineering are likely highly competitive. The most popular majors at WashU include Computer Science, Finance, Research and Experimental Psychology, Economics, and Mechanical Engineering. While there isn't explicit information stating these are harder to get into directly, their popularity suggests a competitive applicant pool.",
      "Be aware that transferring between undergraduate schools (divisions) at WashU is generally considered feasible, but requires careful planning. While some sources suggest internal transfer between schools is 'very easy' or 'quite easy,' others advise caution, noting it typically requires departmental approval and demonstrating the ability to complete the new school's requirements within the four-year timeframe.",
      "Leverage Early Decision if WashU is your top choice, as it significantly increases your chances of admission. The acceptance rate for Early Decision (ED1 and ED2 combined) is substantially higher (25-33%) compared to the Regular Decision acceptance rate (8-10%). Over half of the incoming class is often filled through Early Decision rounds. While not directly about major, applying ED can be a strategic move for overall admission, which then allows you to pursue your chosen major within the university."
