While ODU does not explicitly use terms like \"alternate major strategy\" or \"backup major\" in its admissions guidance, the information available outlines how students can navigate changing their academic path, especially for programs with specific entry requirements.\n\n### Advice on Selecting Backup/Alternate Majors\n\nFor prospective students applying to highly competitive or \"impacted\" majors at Old Dominion University, it is advisable to consider the university's processes for major changes and declaration requirements. Admission to Old Dominion University does not automatically guarantee admission to a specific degree program; some programs require a secondary admission process or specific prerequisites to declare the major.\n\nTherefore, an implied alternate major strategy could involve:\n*   **Applying to a less restrictive major within a desired college or a related field.** For instance, if a student is highly interested in a competitive engineering program but is concerned about direct admission, they might apply to a general science major or another less impacted major within the Batten College of Engineering and Technology, if available, or a related college.\n*   **Focusing on foundational coursework:** Regardless of the initial major, students can proactively take general education courses and introductory courses relevant to their desired competitive major, provided these courses also count towards their declared major. This can prepare them for an internal transfer.\n*   **Utilizing advising resources early:** ODU emphasizes academic advising, and new students are assigned advisors who can guide them through course selection and major exploration. Engaging with an advisor early can help students understand the requirements for their desired major and plan for a potential change.",

      "Submitting a Generic Personal Statement or Essay. ODU requires a personal statement as part of its application. A generic essay that could apply to any university fails to showcase your unique personality, passions, and how you would contribute specifically to the ODU community. Avoid using it as a mere resume rundown or sharing excessive personal information without reflecting on its impact. Ensure your essay highlights what makes you unique and emphasizes your strengths and ambitions.",
      "Neglecting to Provide Strong Letters of Recommendation or a Detailed Activity Resume (if applicable). While letters of recommendation and an activity resume are listed as optional for general undergraduate admission, they are \"strongly recommended\" for institutional scholarship consideration and can provide valuable insights into your character and engagement. A lack of these supplementary materials, especially if your academic record is not exceptionally strong, could be a missed opportunity to present a more compelling profile.",
      "Failing to meet specific program requirements. Admission to the university does not guarantee admission to a specific degree program. Highly competitive programs, such as nursing or engineering, often have additional requirements beyond general university admission. For instance, the prelicensure nursing program requires completion of prerequisite coursework with a minimum GPA of 3.0, and typically a 3.6 GPA or higher to be competitive, along with a HESI A2 Assessment Test. Overlooking these specific departmental requirements can lead to rejection from your desired major, even if admitted to ODU.",
      "Not Submitting Official Transcripts Correctly. ODU clearly states that official high school transcripts (or GED transcripts) are required and must be sent directly from your high school or selected electronic service to the university. Transcripts emailed from the student to ODU are not acceptable. Incorrectly submitting these crucial documents can delay or even jeopardize your application.",
      "Missing the Priority Application Deadline (December 1st). While ODU operates on a rolling admissions basis, they suggest submitting your application by their priority deadline of December 1st. Applying by this date offers the advantage of an earlier decision and makes you eligible for potential scholarships. Missing this deadline could mean fewer scholarship opportunities or a delayed decision."
