First-year students are guaranteed housing for three years, and 97% choose to live on campus, facilitating social connections. The campus provides numerous events, including cultural festivals, speaker series, and athletic showdowns. Greek life also plays a role, with about 15% of undergraduates affiliated with fraternities and sororities. The dining halls are also noted as a place for students to meet and connect.",
      "transportation_impact": "Transportation in Los Angeles can be complex, but UCLA offers various options to connect campus with the city's job and recreational opportunities. Students have access to the Universal Transit Access Pass (U-Pass) for public transportation, with its costs included in student fees, increasing transit pass sales significantly. UCLA Transportation actively promotes public transportation, biking, and walking as sustainable options due to limited and competitive on-campus parking. Improvements are continuously made to pedestrian pathways, bike lanes, and bus services on campus to enhance safety, accessibility, and encourage social engagement. While having a car offers flexibility, it comes with challenges like high costs and parking difficulties, prompting an emphasis on public and active transportation to mitigate these impacts on students' daily lives and access to off-campus opportunities.",
      "research_impact": "UCLA is a major research powerhouse, classified as an 'R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity' institution with substantial annual research expenditures. The Technology Development Group (TDG) actively connects industry partners with UCLA's faculty researchers across various scientific and technical disciplines, facilitating collaboration, sponsored research, technology transfer, intellectual property, and licensing. This fosters a dynamic environment where research innovations can move from concept to clinical application, particularly in areas like medical innovation through programs like the Industry Affiliates Program. Industry collaboration also provides funding opportunities for UCLA researchers."
