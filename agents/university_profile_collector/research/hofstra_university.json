For instance, if applying to a highly selective program within Engineering and Applied Science (such as Computer Science, which can have specific course requirements), an alternate in a broader liberal arts field like Cognitive Science or a related but less competitive STEM major might be a strategic choice. While specific guidance on 'backup majors' during the initial application is not explicitly detailed, Hofstra's admissions are described as selective, and programs like the 4+4 Combined Bachelor's and MD Program and the Honors College are highly selective.; internal_transfer_difficulty: Internal transfer for majors at Hofstra generally involves submitting a 'Change of Study' form and obtaining a signature from the new department. For first-year students, such changes might be facilitated during orientation. However, the ease of internal transfer can vary. Transferring into highly specialized or 'impacted' majors, such as Computer Science, might be more competitive or challenging due to specific course requirements. While Hofstra promotes interdisciplinary programs and aims to make it easier for faculty to create and students to take advantage of such offerings, direct information defining 'impacted majors' or outlining a competitive internal transfer process for them is not explicitly provided. It can be inferred that highly selective programs for initial admission would also have a competitive internal transfer process."
