Morgan State's most popular major is Liberal Arts and Sciences/Liberal Studies, awarding approximately 98 degrees each year.",

For admitted students, being an 'undeclared' or 'General Studies' major is an option, with academic advisors from the Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA) assisting in major exploration and declaration, ideally by the end of the sophomore year. The Applied Liberal Studies program also offers flexibility for students who change majors by allowing previously earned credits to be applied."

      "Strong Recommendations: Letters of recommendation are a required component of the application process, indicating their significance in the admissions decision.",
      "Competitive SAT/ACT Scores (if submitted): While SAT/ACT scores are considered but not always required, submitting scores within the average range (e.g., 860-1080 on the SAT or 17-21 on the ACT) can strengthen an applicant's profile and increase their chances of acceptance.",
      "Well-Crafted Essays/Personal Statement: Although not explicitly detailed as a \"student success factor\" for admission in the search results, the importance of a thoughtful essay is highlighted in discussions about application components. An essay that effectively conveys a student's plans, inspirations, and connection to the university's mission can be impactful.",
      "Meaningful Extracurricular Involvement and Leadership: While not directly stated as an admission requirement from student testimonials on getting in, the overall student experience at Morgan State emphasizes growth through various opportunities and organizations. Demonstrating engagement in extracurriculars and leadership roles in high school can suggest a proactive and well-rounded applicant, which is generally valued in college admissions."
