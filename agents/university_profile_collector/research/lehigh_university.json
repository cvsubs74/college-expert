        "insight": "Lehigh University employs a holistic admissions process and has maintained a test-optional policy for undergraduate applicants for the Fall 2025 admission cycle, considering a broad range of factors beyond standardized test scores.",
        "implication": "Applicants should focus on presenting a strong overall profile, including academic performance, course rigor, extracurriculars, essays, and recommendations, as test scores are not mandatory but can be considered if submitted."

        "category": "Social Life",
        "insight": "While Lehigh offers a vibrant social scene with over 200 clubs and activities, Greek life and sports play a significant role in shaping the campus culture, which can sometimes make it challenging for non-affiliated students to find consistent social connections.",
        "implication": "Prospective students not interested in Greek life or sports should actively explore and engage with the numerous other clubs and organizations to build their social network."

    ],
    "campus_dynamics": {
      "social_environment": "Lehigh University fosters a vibrant and genuine campus community with a 'work hard, play hard' reputation. While Greek life (21% undergraduate affiliation in Fall 2023) and sports are prominent aspects of the social scene, the university offers over 200 clubs and organizations, alongside school-sponsored events like 'Lehigh After Dark,' providing diverse social outlets. Despite the influence of Greek life, many students find fulfilling social experiences outside of fraternities and sororities by actively participating in other campus groups and traditions.",
      "transportation_impact": "The hilly Bethlehem campus is served by an extensive on-campus bus system (GoLehigh Transit app for tracking), bike-sharing programs, and ridesharing options, promoting a pedestrian and bike-friendly environment. Lehigh's 'Connections Plan' aims to reduce reliance on single-occupancy vehicles and improve campus connectivity. Off-campus, students have access to regional and international bus services (Trans-Bridge Lines, Greyhound) connecting to local areas, regional transportation hubs, and major airports like Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), which facilitates travel to and from the university.",
      "research_impact": "As an R1 research university, Lehigh is deeply committed to impactful, interdisciplinary research that addresses real-world problems. The university actively promotes collaborative research between faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students, often leading to publications and conference presentations. Strong industry partnerships through various centers and institutes (e.g., Center for Supply Chain Research, Dexter F. Baker Institute for Entrepreneurship) provide students with valuable real-world experience, sponsored research opportunities, internships, and a robust talent pipeline for partner companies."

The Office of the Registrar holds final authority for credit awarded. Departments may require syllabi for course evaluation. Generally, no more than half of the required credits for a degree can be transfer credits, implying a cap of approximately 64 credits. Certain departments, like Economics, have additional restrictions, such as not accepting community college courses unless under an articulation agreement. No credit is granted for continuing education unit courses, correspondence, or independent study without advanced approval.
