Most majors do not require four full years to complete, providing ample time to decide. Academic advisors are available to assist undeclared students in researching majors and selecting introductory courses in areas of interest.",
      "Be aware of direct-admit programs like Nursing. Certain professional schools, such as the Marcella Niehoff School of Nursing, require students to apply directly to the program when applying to the university and begin the program in their freshman year. It is generally not possible to transfer into these programs later. This implies that some majors have a more structured and competitive entry process from the outset.",
      "Focus on a strong academic profile regardless of major. While specific major-specific admit rates are not provided, Loyola University Chicago has a holistic admissions process, with a strong emphasis on academic strength. Admitted students generally have a high GPA (average around 3.74-3.91) and strong standardized test scores, even though the university is test-optional. Challenging high school coursework, including AP or IB classes, is also considered important. This suggests that a strong overall application is key, rather than trying to find a 'backdoor' through a less competitive major, with the exception of specific direct-admit programs.",
      "Apply early, especially for merit scholarships.

For prospective students considering a competitive major, it can be inferred that listing a backup in a different college, such as selecting Cognitive Science as an alternate if applying to Computer Science in Engineering, could be a viable strategy, given the structured internal transfer process for switching between different schools/colleges after admission.",
    "internal_transfer_difficulty": "Internal transfers for changing majors between different schools or colleges (e.g., from the College of Arts and Sciences to the Quinlan School of Business) require submitting an Internal Transfer Application.

Loyola University Chicago considers a rigorous high school curriculum important, and consistent academic performance is expected.",

Even one low grade, like a D, could raise concerns after acceptance. Loyola University Chicago considers a rigorous high school curriculum important, and consistent academic performance is expected.",
      "Generic essays that could apply anywhere: Your personal essay is an opportunity to showcase your unique personality, values, and motivations. A generic essay that lacks specific details about your experiences or your genuine interest in Loyola University Chicago will not effectively convey who you are beyond your academic record.",
      "List of activities without depth or impact: While extracurricular involvement is valued, Loyola emphasizes 'quality more than quantity.' Listing many short-term commitments without demonstrating deep engagement, leadership, or significant impact in a few activities can be less impressive than focused, meaningful involvement.",
      "Poor letters of recommendation from teachers who don't know you well: Although letters of recommendation are optional, strong ones can significantly enhance an application. Generic or unenthusiastic letters from recommenders who don't know you well or cannot speak to your specific strengths and character can be a missed opportunity to present a comprehensive view of yourself."
