      {
        "category": "Academic",
        "insight": "USF is recognized for strong programs in Nursing, Marketing, Finance, and its nationally recognized School of Management with an excellent entrepreneurship program. The university also emphasizes small class sizes and operates with a test-optional admissions policy.",
        "implication": "Prospective students interested in these highlighted fields should demonstrate their passion and relevant experiences in their application essays and activities. Applicants should also decide strategically whether to submit SAT/ACT scores based on if they accurately reflect their academic ability, given USF's test-optional policy and superscoring practice."

    "campus_dynamics": {
      "social_environment": "The University of San Francisco (USF) offers a lively and diverse social environment, where students can form strong relationships with professors and peers. Many students appreciate the welcoming atmosphere and the strong sense of community. The university's emphasis on social justice is also a significant aspect of campus life, encouraging students to engage with their environment and explore their potential. The surrounding city of San Francisco provides ample opportunities for exploration, cultural experiences, and meeting people from diverse backgrounds, which contributes significantly to the overall social atmosphere.",
      "transportation_impact": "Transportation significantly impacts campus life at USF, largely due to its urban location in San Francisco. Undergraduates receive a semester pass for all SF Muni lines (buses, streetcars, and Muni Subway), providing unlimited public transit access throughout the city. This makes it convenient for students to explore San Francisco's attractions, internships, and job opportunities. While the campus is centrally located and walkable, direct BART access is not available, and driving a car can be challenging due to traffic and parking limitations. The university also offers Zipcars on campus, carpool services, bike racks, and shuttle services (ADA, Night Safety, and Safety Escort) to further assist with student mobility.",
      "research_impact": "The University of San Francisco offers strong undergraduate research opportunities, with faculty actively involving students in projects for course credit or as volunteers. Specific programs like the Whitehead Summer Research Fellowship support students in Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Biology. The university's location in San Francisco provides extensive access to research, internship, and employment opportunities with successful companies in the Bay Area. Professors often have close ties to local industries, particularly leveraging San Francisco's role in data science. The Career Services Center facilitates connections between students, employers, and alumni, including company visits and on-campus recruitment. USF also has research centers and institutes focusing on innovative, interdisciplinary, and socially conscious studies. Historically, a USF professor co-founded Genentech, a pioneering biotech company, highlighting the university's long-standing industry connections. The university integrates social justice into technology and engages with the broader San Francisco Bay Area community through its research endeavors."

USF states that this decision reflects their belief in a holistic review process and that test scores are not always reflective of a student's potential. Applicants will not be penalized for not submitting scores and remain eligible for merit scholarships. Students are encouraged to submit scores only if they feel the scores accurately represent their academic accomplishments and potential, and particularly if their scores exceed the average of the fall class student profile. If test scores are not submitted, greater weight will be placed on other application components, such as the short answer question and academic profile. International students, however, must demonstrate English language proficiency through official TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo scores, or by meeting specified waiver requirements.",

The breadth and depth of these foundational courses can significantly impact a student's academic experience, allowing for exploration of new passions or a more focused approach.",
      "Assess 4-Year Graduation Rates and Program-Specific Outcomes: While overall university graduation rates are available, students should research if specific schools or programs within USF have distinct 4-year (or program-specific) graduation rates, as well as career placement and postgraduate success statistics for their majors. This can indicate the efficacy of a program's structure and support in guiding students to timely completion and successful next steps. USF states that its graduates rank among the top 3% in the U.S. for earning potential, which is an overall indicator.",

For instance, if applying for Computer Science in Engineering, one might consider Cognitive Science as an alternate. However, it's crucial to note that some universities may not consider alternate majors at all, or only for specific colleges or under limited options.
