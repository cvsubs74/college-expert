    "executive_summary": "Boston College is a private Catholic Jesuit research university renowned for its strong liberal arts, scientific inquiry, and formative education. It consistently ranks among the top national universities and is highly selective, attracting academically talented and community-oriented students.",
    "market_position": "Elite Private",
    "admissions_philosophy": "Boston College employs a holistic review process, seeking a new generation of leaders who are academically talented, intellectually curious, desire a close-knit community, and are eager to use their talents to improve society. The university values personal growth, character formation, and service, aligning with its Jesuit mission. While test-optional, a significant majority (74%) of admitted students still submit test scores.

    "campus_dynamics": {
      "social_environment": "Boston College offers a vibrant social life centered around traditions, community events, and numerous student organizations. Most students live on campus during their first, second, and fourth years, fostering a strong sense of community and facilitating friendships. While the social scene includes parties, some describe it as more 'low-key' than other universities, with a focus on a balance between academics and social activities. Official Greek life is absent, though some 'underground' fraternities exist off-campus. Opportunities for non-alcoholic events are also available, and students frequently utilize Boston's broader social scene.",
      "transportation_impact": "Located in Chestnut Hill, approximately six miles west of downtown Boston, Boston College benefits from convenient access to the city. The MBTA Green Line ('B' line) stops directly at the campus, and free BC Shuttle services connect the various campuses and surrounding areas. This robust transportation network allows students to easily access Boston's cultural attractions, nightlife, and other collegiate events, expanding their social and academic opportunities beyond the immediate campus.",
      "research_impact": "As a 'Research 1: Very High Research Spending and Doctorate Production' university, Boston College is deeply committed to providing diverse research opportunities for undergraduates across the humanities, sciences, business, and education. Programs include undergraduate research fellowships, independent study, senior honors theses, and various summer fellowships and grants for student-designed projects, conference travel, and thesis expenses. Students can also pursue research experiences in faculty labs on campus or through off-campus opportunities at biomedical institutions in the greater Boston area."
