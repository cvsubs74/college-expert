      "social_environment": "Life at Georgia Tech is described as collaborative and hands-on, fostering a community built on curiosity and connection [10]. There are hundreds of student organizations, leadership programs, and campus traditions, providing ample opportunities to get involved and meet people [10, 31]. While academics are rigorous, students find ways to connect, with a significant portion involved in Greek life, and a diverse range of clubs from academic to outdoor activities [30, 35, 36]. The campus environment is noted for its innovation and supportive community, where students are willing to help each other, countering the 'nerdy' stereotype with a mix of outgoing and academically focused individuals [30, 35, 36].",
      "transportation_impact": "Georgia Tech's campus, located in Midtown Atlanta, is highly accessible through various transportation options. The campus itself is served by the Stinger Bus and Stingerette (after-hours shuttle), and Zipcar is available for short-term car rentals [6, 16, 20]. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) provides rail and bus service with two convenient stops near campus (North Avenue and Midtown Stations), offering inexpensive transit, including to Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport [6, 24]. Discounted monthly MARTA passes are available for students and employees [6, 24]. This robust transportation network allows students to easily navigate campus, access internships and cultural experiences in Atlanta, and provides connections to the wider metropolitan area.",
      "research_impact": "Georgia Tech is a top research university globally, with extensive research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students [3, 15, 23]. It is recognized for its research leadership, playing a key role in the Georgia Research Alliance and conducting research for industry and government [3]. Opportunities include working with the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), which offers real-life research experience and training, and participating in programs like the Petit Undergraduate Research Scholars Program, Vertically-Integrated Projects Program (VIP), and Opportunity Research Scholars Program (ORS) [7, 9, 15, 23]. The institution emphasizes hands-on learning, with high rankings for undergraduate research/creative projects [3, 13] and internships/co-ops [13, 21]. This strong research focus ensures students are actively contributing to discovery, developing critical thinking skills, and are well-prepared for real-world problem-solving and impactful careers [9, 12, 23]."

      "The institution employs holistic review, considering a wide variety of factors beyond just scores and GPA, including a student's context and contributions to their community.",
      "Opportunities for hands-on learning, research, internships, and co-ops are abundant and highly valued, preparing students for the job market.",
      "Majors, especially high-demand ones like Computer Science, can be competitive, and applying to under-subscribed majors might, in some cases, be perceived as easier, though admissions claims not to admit by major."
