While Greek life is a significant part of the social scene, it is not a prerequisite for an active social life, with many students engaging in athletic events, club activities, concerts, and campus traditions like the Lighting of the Lawn. Despite a reputation for an active party scene, students generally maintain a strong balance between academics and social engagements. Campus life is further enhanced by attractive Jeffersonian architecture and a variety of housing and dining options.",
      "transportation_impact": "The University Transit Service (UTS) provides fare-free bus transportation around the university grounds and connects with Charlottesville Area Transit (CAT) buses, facilitating easy movement for students, faculty, and staff. While parking on Grounds is limited and requires permits, the robust bus system mitigates the need for personal vehicles for daily campus commuting. This integrated transit system encourages walking and biking, contributing to a more pedestrian-friendly campus environment.",
      "research_impact": "As an 'R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity' institution, UVA offers extensive research opportunities across various disciplines. Undergraduate students can participate in research through independent study courses, summer internship programs (especially in the School of Medicine), and by collaborating with faculty. The emphasis on collaborative research, even across departments and with external institutions, allows students to engage in cutting-edge discoveries and develop critical skills, enhancing their academic and career prospects."
