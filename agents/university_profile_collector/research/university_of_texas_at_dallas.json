Considering other fields can potentially increase your chances of admission to the university.",
      "Consider applying to a less competitive major within your desired school with the intention of transferring internally later. The University evaluates applicants for their ability to succeed in their chosen major. If not admitted to a first-choice major, students may be admitted to their second choice. It may be easier to transfer between majors within the same school after your first semester if you meet the new major's requirements.",
      "Thoroughly research major-specific admission requirements and average applicant profiles before applying. Certain schools or majors, such as those within the Naveen Jindal School of Management, may have specific minimum test score requirements (e.g., a minimum ACT score of 23 or an SAT score of 1130). Understanding these benchmarks can help in making a strategic choice.",
      "Explore interdisciplinary or broader programs if you are undecided or aiming for a highly competitive field.

Admitted students can request to change their major after the Census Day of their first semester, but the request is evaluated by the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education for the intended major's school based on the student's academic record and potential for success.",

      "Strong Academic Record with Challenging Coursework: A high school GPA is required, with most admitted students having GPAs between 3.5 and 4.0. Competitive SAT scores typically range from 1170-1390 and ACT scores from 24-32, though these are considered but not always required. The university emphasizes academic rigor and expects students to be prepared for challenging courses.",
      "Meaningful Extracurricular Involvement and Leadership: Students and admissions information highlight the importance of getting involved in student organizations, clubs, and activities, and even starting new ones. This demonstrates initiative, engagement beyond academics, and the potential for leadership, contributing to a well-rounded profile.",

Applicants who show genuine interest and passion in their chosen areas of study, perhaps through relevant projects, clubs, or coursework, are likely to stand out.",
      "Authentic and Reflective Essays (implied for holistic review): While not explicitly detailed in student testimonials for undergraduate admissions, the consideration of \"holistic factors\" in the application process implies that essays play a role.

      "Show, Don't Tell - Use Concrete Examples: Rather than simply stating you possess certain qualities or passions, illustrate them with concrete examples and experiences. This allows the admissions committee to see your personality and what makes you tick beyond grades and test scores.",
      "Reflect on Your Personal and Professional Self: Use the essay to communicate who you are, your accomplishments, and your goals. Incorporate aspects of both your personal and professional life to provide a well-rounded introduction to yourself and demonstrate why the program will benefit your life.",
      "Strive for Flawless and Concise Writing: Admissions counselors have limited time to review essays, so ensure your writing is accurate, detailed, and grammatically correct. Keep your message clear and to the point, conveying who you are and why you are a good fit without unnecessary طول.",
      "Demonstrate Passion (and how it aligns with UTD): Show genuine passion for your chosen field, the program, or something else significant in your life that connects back to UTD.

    "red_flags": [
      "Significant Grade Decline or Low Academic Performance: A low GPA, low class rank, or a history of failing classes can be a major red flag for admissions, even if test scores are high. While improvements in senior year might help, consistent academic struggles are a concern.",
      "Generic or Unoriginal Essays: Admissions officers advise against writing essays that sound like what you think they want to hear or that could apply to any other applicant. Avoid simply listing accomplishments from your resume; instead, use the essay to demonstrate your unique personality, what you've learned, and your genuine passions.",
      "Extracurriculars and Skills Lacking Depth or Relevance: While having extracurriculars is good, those that don't demonstrate a clear connection to your desired major or higher education goals, or that lack significant impact, may not strengthen your application. Focus on activities that showcase depth of involvement and meaningful contributions.",
      "Poor Quality Letters of Recommendation: If you choose to submit letters of recommendation (UT Dallas encourages but doesn't require them, limiting them to three), ensure they come from individuals who know you well and can speak genuinely and positively about your abilities and character. Bad recommendations can actively hurt your chances.",
      "Submitting a Late Application or Failing to Follow Instructions: Applying late can result in rejection, particularly if the program or major you're interested in has already reached its capacity. Additionally, ignoring or skipping application instructions can be seen as a failure to follow directions, which can negatively impact your application."
