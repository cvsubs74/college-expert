Admissions decisions are made holistically, considering academic records (GPA, coursework), standardized test scores, extracurricular involvement, leadership experience, and personal essays. Emphasis is placed on identifying students who demonstrate potential for academic achievement and a commitment to contributing positively to the university's vibrant community.",

While it is largely a commuter school, parking can be a challenge, requiring permits for on-campus parking. To mitigate this, UNT offers a free Park and Ride option, additional programs like ridesharing, E-Ride, a Lyft program, and hourly rental cars (Zipcar), and a live GIS parking map to assist with finding spaces.",

These opportunities include individual research with faculty mentors, participation in national and international team competitions, and various Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs, some of which are specific to fields like Computer Science and Engineering, Data Science, and Biology. Engaging in research has been shown to increase graduation rates and the likelihood of pursuing graduate studies."
