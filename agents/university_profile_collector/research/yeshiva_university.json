For instance, a student interested in business would focus on the offerings of Sy Syms School of Business, while those pursuing liberal arts or sciences would look closely at Yeshiva College or Stern College for Women.",
      "Assess Campus Environment and Student Life Fit: Consider the specific social and cultural environment of each college. Yeshiva College and Stern College for Women, being single-gender institutions, offer distinct student life experiences compared to co-ed environments or other universities. Factors such as campus size, religious affiliation, housing options, and extracurricular activities should be weighed. Yeshiva University's unique \"Torah Umadda\" philosophy, which integrates secular and Jewish studies, is a key aspect of its environment.",

This can provide insight into the institution's effectiveness in guiding students to completion and future opportunities. Yeshiva University, as a whole, has a reported graduation rate of 85%.",
      "Review Financial Aid and Cost of Attendance: While not always a ranking factor in terms of academic quality, the overall cost and available financial aid packages are crucial for many students. Comparing the net cost after scholarships and grants for each college can significantly influence a student's final decision."
    ],
    "alternate_major_strategy": "Yeshiva University's application process does not typically involve formally declaring a \"backup\" or \"alternate\" major in the same way some larger universities with highly competitive, direct-admit programs might. The university employs a holistic admissions review, evaluating applicants based on academic performance, character, leadership, extracurricular activities, essays, and interviews. While applicants may indicate an intended field of study, the primary admission decision is for acceptance to the university as a whole. Applying as an undeclared student is also a viable option, allowing students to explore various academic interests before committing to a specific program. Once admitted to Yeshiva University, students have considerable flexibility in choosing and changing their major. Many students may remain undecided during their first year and formally declare their major closer to their junior year. Students can declare, change, or add a second major at any time before graduation by submitting the \"Declaration of Academic Major & Minors\" form through the Office of the Registrar. Yeshiva University provides several resources to support students in their major decisions: Academic Advisors, Career Center, and a \"Shaped Major\" Option for interdisciplinary interests. Changing majors internally is generally flexible. However, for certain programs, such as switching into a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Computer Science from another major, students may need to take summer courses to ensure they graduate within the standard eight semesters, depending on their prior coursework. It's also important to note that due to New York State Education Department rules, students cannot double major if one degree is a B.S. and the other is a B.A., though pursuing a minor in another department is permissible."
