Students also have access to Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) public buses and can use their CMU ID for rides. Additionally, Zipcar is available on campus, and ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft are popular in Pittsburgh. The public bus service also connects the airport directly to campus. These options minimize the need for personal vehicles for most students.",
      "research_impact": "Research is a cornerstone of the Carnegie Mellon experience, with extensive opportunities available for undergraduates across all fields of study. The Office of Undergraduate Research and Scholar Development provides grants, fellowships (like SURA, SURF, ISURF, SURG), and presentation awards. CMU is known for its interdisciplinary research, particularly in areas like engineering, computer science, and data science, with strong ties to industry and a focus on developing innovative solutions for real-world problems. The university's research institutes, such as Traffic21, leverage the Pittsburgh region as a 'learning lab' to test new solutions, further integrating research into the local community and providing hands-on experience."
