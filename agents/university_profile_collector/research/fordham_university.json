    "campus_dynamics": {
      "social_environment": "Fordham offers a diverse social environment spread across its Rose Hill and Lincoln Center campuses. Rose Hill provides a more traditional college atmosphere with numerous clubs, intramurals, and a social scene that includes local bars and some house parties, often described as 'very Irish' with drinking as a primary social activity. Lincoln Center, located in Manhattan, offers a more urban, artsy, and free-spirited atmosphere with smaller classes and a focus on diversity. Over 240 student organizations, including academic, cultural, performing arts, service, and sports clubs, cater to a wide range of interests and encourage community building and exploration of NYC.",
      "transportation_impact": "Transportation significantly impacts campus life, particularly the connection between the Rose Hill (Bronx) and Lincoln Center (Manhattan) campuses. The 'Ram Van' shuttle service provides a safe and convenient way for students, staff, and faculty to travel between these campuses. Additionally, Fordham offers an on-campus shuttle at Rose Hill for internal travel and provides information and services for airport transportation. This extensive transportation network allows students to easily access the vast opportunities and diverse experiences offered by both campus locations and New York City.",
      "research_impact": "Fordham University emphasizes undergraduate research, providing ample opportunities for students across various disciplines. Programs like the Calder Summer Undergraduate Research (CSUR) and the Summer Undergraduate Research Program at Rose Hill offer stipends and mentorship for independent research projects. Students can also secure competitive research grants, work with faculty, and engage in research at nearby prestigious institutions such as Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. This strong research focus allows undergraduates to gain direct experience, co-author publications, present at conferences, and build a competitive portfolio for future academic or professional endeavors. Business students also have opportunities through research center fellowships."
