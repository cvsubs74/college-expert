    "campus_dynamics": {
      "social_environment": "Gonzaga University boasts a vibrant, close-knit, and community-oriented social environment. With over 130 clubs and organizations, students have diverse opportunities for engagement. There is no Greek life; instead, social activities often revolve around house parties and informal student-led gatherings, particularly on weekends. The campus is known for its strong school spirit, especially supporting the Gonzaga Bulldogs athletic teams, with basketball being a significant part of the social fabric. The Jesuit identity fosters a culture of collaboration, service, and development of the whole person. Spokane's mid-sized city environment also offers external dining, entertainment, and outdoor recreational options.",
      "transportation_impact": "Gonzaga's campus is located in Spokane, Washington, with the Spokane International Airport (GEG) a 15-minute drive away. While the university does not offer a dedicated airport shuttle, ride-share services, taxis, and hotel shuttles are available. Within the city, Gonzaga students and employees benefit from the Spokane Transit Universal Transit Access Pass (UTAP) Program, allowing their ZAGCARD to function as a bus pass at no additional cost. The new City Line bus route directly serves the campus, enhancing connectivity to downtown Spokane. Additionally, the university encourages sustainable commuting through carpooling, biking, and readily available Lime e-scooters and e-bikes. This comprehensive approach to transportation ensures students have convenient options for both local and longer-distance travel.",
      "research_impact": "Gonzaga University strongly emphasizes undergraduate research as a transformative learning experience. The Center for Undergraduate Research & Creative Inquiry (CURCI) serves as a central hub, administering funds and facilitating opportunities across natural sciences, mathematics, engineering, and computer science through programs like the Gonzaga Science Research Program, GRO-MECS, and various fellowships. Students are encouraged to participate in original scholarly projects, present their findings at conferences (supported by travel awards), and engage in interdisciplinary inquiry rooted in Ignatian values. This focus on hands-on research and faculty mentorship equips students with critical thinking skills, fostering lifelong learning, creativity, and innovation."
