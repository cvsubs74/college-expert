International first-year applicants can waive SAT/ACT and English proficiency exams if their secondary institution provides written verification that the means of instruction is in English, they are enrolled in an IB curriculum, attend an American School, or are enrolled in a curriculum that leads to Cambridge International Examinations. Applicants with a strong GPA (3.000 or higher) and evidence of outstanding academic success throughout high school are encouraged to use the No Test Option, especially if their test scores are below the suggested minimums (SAT 1120, ACT 23). Applicants who scored 1120 or higher on the SAT or 23 or higher on the ACT are considered good candidates to submit test scores."

    "alternate_major_strategy": "For prospective students applying to highly competitive majors at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, strategically selecting an alternate major or understanding the internal transfer process is crucial. If a student is applying to a highly competitive major, such as Computer Science, Nursing, or Engineering, and is concerned about direct admission to that program, they might consider applying to a less competitive major within a related college as an initial entry point to the university. This approach aims to secure admission to UMass Lowell first, with the understanding that a major change would be pursued later. Examples: for Computer Science, consider a less competitive major in a related field within a different college or an undeclared option. Changing majors after admission is possible but depends on available space and meeting all admission requirements for the desired program. Competitive majors like Computer Science, Engineering, and Nursing have specific GPA and course requirements for internal transfer, with Nursing being extremely limited. For other majors, changes can be initiated through the Solution Center, typically requiring a minimum GPA. Intercollegiate transfers require dean and department chairperson signatures. Changing majors, especially later in studies, may extend graduation time."
