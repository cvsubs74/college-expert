      "transportation_impact": "Given its large commuter base, transportation significantly impacts campus life. Parking is often challenging and costly, leading many students to rely on carpooling, public transit (Long Beach Transit, LA Metro connections), or ridesharing. The campus's accessibility via major freeways contributes to traffic congestion during peak hours, necessitating ongoing efforts to promote sustainable and alternative transportation methods.",
      "research_impact": "While primarily a comprehensive teaching institution within the CSU system, CSULB has a growing and increasingly impactful research footprint. Faculty engage in significant grant-funded research, often involving undergraduate and graduate students, particularly in applied sciences, engineering, and the arts. This research contributes to regional innovation, addresses community challenges, and enhances the university's academic reputation while providing invaluable experiential learning opportunities for students."

    "alternate_major_strategy": "alternate_major_strategy: California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) does not routinely consider alternate majors for applicants. If a prospective student does not qualify for their primary major, they will not be considered for an alternate. The only exception is for 'local' first-time, first-year applicants who are not admitted to their specific major; they may be offered admission as undeclared students. However, being admitted as undeclared is not a pathway to an initially intended impacted major, and these students work with advisors to identify and pursue alternative majors. For transfer students, it is critical to carefully choose a major upon application, as alternate majors will not be considered if the first choice is not met. CSULB strongly advises all applicants to have a backup plan, which typically means applying to other institutions.; internal_transfer_difficulty: CSULB is an impacted campus, making the internal transfer (change of major after admission) process competitive, especially for impacted majors. Students wishing to change majors must meet precise major-specific criteria, including successfully completing required coursework and demonstrating academic potential in the new major. For transfer students, changing majors is generally discouraged due to admission being tied to meeting major-specific requirements and the university's timely graduation policy. While changing majors within the same college might be somewhat easier, transferring to a different college or a highly impacted major could even necessitate returning to a community college to complete lower-division requirements for the desired new major. Students considering a change should consult with department advisors for the new major and utilize resources like the University Center for Undergraduate Advising (UCUA) for major exploration."
