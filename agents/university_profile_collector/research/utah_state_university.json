This allows students to explore different fields before committing. Academic advisors are available to assist students in the exploratory program.",
      "Research Major-Specific Requirements and Competitiveness: While USU has a relatively high overall acceptance rate (91-94%), some majors have higher GPA requirements or additional admission criteria beyond the general university standards. Certain programs, like some in Business, Engineering, and Education, are highlighted as popular and potentially more sought-after. It's beneficial to investigate the specific admission standards and, if possible, the competitiveness of your desired major. Some programs might require an application, essay, or interview process for admission into the major itself.",
      "Explore a Range of Interests and Popular Majors: Utah State offers a wide array of majors across various colleges. Popular majors include Liberal Arts and Humanities, Economics, Communication Disorders, Psychology, Elementary Education, Kinesiology, Finance, Marketing, Mechanical Engineering, and Nursing. The university also provides tools like personality tests to help align interests with potential majors, particularly within the Huntsman School of Business.",
      "Connect with Departments and Advisors: Before making a decision, consider exploring specific departments, looking into their curricula, faculty, and resources. Speaking with students enrolled in those majors or sitting in on classes or seminars, if possible, can provide valuable insights. Academic advisors are a key resource to help understand how major changes might affect graduation timelines."

    "college_ranking_tactics": [
      "Assess the Strength and Specialization of Academic Programs and Majors: Focus on the specific academic programs and majors offered within each college that align with your interests. Consider the reputation and strength of those programs, the faculty's expertise, and the availability of specialized resources or facilities. For example, if interested in agriculture, the College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences, which includes a robotic dairy and hands-on learning, would be a key consideration.",
      "Investigate Research Opportunities and Hands-on Learning: Look into the research opportunities and practical experiences available within each college. Some programs, like ecology or watershed sciences at USU, are noted for groundbreaking research and attract students globally. Hands-on learning experiences, such as those in the College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences, can significantly impact your education.",
      "Evaluate Faculty Expertise and Mentorship: The quality of instruction and the potential for mentorship from professors are crucial. Students often appreciate approachable and caring professors, and this can vary by college or department. Researching the faculty within a specific college can provide insight into their expertise and whether they align with your academic goals.",
      "Consider Post-Graduation Success and Career Preparation: While less specific to individual colleges, understanding how well a particular college within USU prepares its students for careers can be a ranking factor. This might involve looking at internship opportunities, career services specific to that college, and the success rates of graduates in relevant fields.",
      "Examine Unique Resources and Facilities: Some colleges may have distinct facilities or resources that enhance the learning experience. For example, the College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences has a South Farm Equine Center and a robotic dairy. These unique offerings can be a significant factor when evaluating the suitability of a particular college for your studies."

    "alternate_major_strategy": "summary: Utah State University (USU) offers pathways for students to explore their academic interests and change majors, both before and after admission. While the university doesn't explicitly outline a \"backup major strategy\" in the sense of applying to a less competitive program with the intent to transfer, several mechanisms and considerations can guide applicants and current students.; applying_with_alternate_or_exploratory_major: For prospective students who may not meet the direct admission requirements for a highly competitive major, USU may offer an \"Exploratory\" major. This option is available to applicants with at least a 2.0 GPA and fewer than 60 transfer credits who do not meet the admissions requirements for their desired major. This can serve as an de facto alternate major pathway, allowing students to gain admission to the university while working towards their preferred field of study.; changing_majors_after_admission: {'before_classes_begin': 'Incoming students who wish to change their major before starting classes should contact the Admissions Office via email (admit@usu.edu) or submit an incoming student major change form. It is also recommended to review the First Semester Registration guide for the desired new major and speak with its academic advisor.', 'after_classes_begin_current_students': 'Current USU students need to meet with the academic advisor of their desired major to initiate a change. Advisors can provide guidance on program requirements and help create a realistic plan for admission to the new program.'}; internal_transfer_difficulty_for_impacted_majors: While the general process for changing majors is clear, the difficulty of internally transferring into \"impacted\" or competitive majors can vary. The College of Engineering, for example, states that submitting a change of major request \"does not guarantee admission to my desired major\" and emphasizes that students must meet the requirements for the desired major to take pre-professional courses. This suggests that competitive programs may have specific prerequisites or GPA requirements that students must fulfill before being fully admitted to that major, even as an internal transfer. Students should work closely with an advisor to understand these specific requirements.; impact_of_strategic_reinvestment_on_programs: Utah State University is undergoing a strategic reinvestment plan, as mandated by Utah House Bill 265, which involves reallocating funds and may result in the discontinuation of some academic programs, particularly those with low enrollment or limited workforce demand. While most students in affected programs will be able to complete their degrees through a \"teach-out\" protocol, students who have completed less than 50% of their program will work with academic advisors to explore related majors or alternative pathways. This ongoing process highlights the importance of staying informed and working with academic advisors when considering majors, especially in areas that might be subject to review.; in_summary: {'alternate_major_strategy': 'While not formally labeled, applying as an \"Exploratory\" major can be a strategy for students not meeting direct admission requirements for a specific program, offering a path into the university.', 'internal_transfer_difficulty': 'Changing majors generally requires contacting the desired major\\'s advisor. However, competitive or \"impacted\" majors, such as those in the College of Engineering, will likely have specific admission requirements that must be met for internal transfers, meaning a change is not guaranteed until those criteria are fulfilled.', 'changing_major_after_admission': 'It is possible to change your major both before classes begin (by contacting Admissions) and after enrollment (by meeting with an academic advisor).', 'competitive_internal_transfer_process': 'For highly sought-after fields, students should anticipate needing to meet specific academic benchmarks and work closely with advisors to successfully transfer into these programs.'}",

This approach allows the admissions committee to get a clearer picture of your personality, drive, and ambitions beyond your academic achievements.",
      "Be Specific About Your Connection to USU (Especially for Honors or Optional Essays): If you choose to submit an optional essay or are applying to the Honors Program, articulate why Utah State University, or a particular program, major, or academic activity within it, interests you. For instance, the Honors Program prompts specifically ask how certain majors or activities at USU might capture your imagination and foster curiosity. While direct references to faculty are mentioned for graduate applications, the underlying principle of showing genuine, researched interest in USU's offerings can be adapted for undergraduate essays.",
      "Highlight Your Unique Qualities, Interests, and Experiences: Whether addressing a Common App prompt or an Honors essay, focus on showcasing what makes you distinctive. Reflect on your background, identity, talents, and any obstacles you've overcome. This helps the admissions committee understand you as a person and what you would bring to the USU community.",
      "Demonstrate Curiosity and Engagement (Crucial for Honors Program): The USU Honors Program specifically looks for students who are curious, engaged, and resilient. In your essays, describe moments where you became deeply curious about an idea or activity and how you explored that interest creatively. Connect your curiosity to specific academic activities or courses at USU."

Grades of A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, and P (Pass) may be transferred and recorded. For courses to count towards a major or minor, a minimum grade of 'C' is generally required, though some departments may approve a 'C-'. There is no explicit general cap on the number of credits that can be transferred from community colleges; however, all accepted transfer credits may not necessarily apply to graduation requirements. For financial aid purposes, undergraduate students typically have a maximum timeframe of 150% of the credits required for their degree (e.g., 180 credits for a 120-credit bachelor's degree), which includes all attempted credits, including transfer credits."

Taking college preparatory courses is also recommended.",

For all applicants, when essays are submitted (even if optional), an authentic essay that demonstrates self-reflection and clearly articulates goals can strengthen the application."

      "Show, Don't Tell; Use Concrete Examples: Instead of simply stating your qualities, illustrate them with specific stories, anecdotes, or memories. This approach allows the admissions committee to get a clearer picture of your personality, drive, and ambitions beyond your academic achievements.",
      "Be Specific About Your Connection to USU (Especially for Honors or Optional Essays): If you choose to submit an optional essay or are applying to the Honors Program, articulate why Utah State University, or a particular program, major, or academic activity within it, interests you. For instance, the Honors Program prompts specifically ask how certain majors or activities at USU might capture your imagination and foster curiosity. While direct references to faculty are mentioned for graduate applications, the underlying principle of showing genuine, researched interest in USU's offerings can be adapted for undergraduate essays.",
      "Highlight Your Unique Qualities, Interests, and Experiences: Whether addressing a Common App prompt or an Honors essay, focus on showcasing what makes you distinctive. Reflect on your background, identity, talents, and any obstacles you've overcome. This helps the admissions committee understand you as a person and what you would bring to the USU community.",
      "Demonstrate Curiosity and Engagement (Crucial for Honors Program): The USU Honors Program specifically looks for students who are curious, engaged, and resilient. In your essays, describe moments where you became deeply curious about an idea or activity and how you explored that interest creatively. Connect your curiosity to specific academic activities or courses at USU."

The figure for median earnings 6 years after enrollment is interpreted as the median starting salary of USU alumni, which is $51,600, and is noted to be measured by the U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard in the second full year after the student completed their award. A direct 'employment rate 2 years after graduation' was not found in the authoritative sources. The closest available data indicates that just over 80 percent of bachelor's degree graduates had a positive outcome (including employment, self-employment, service, military, or continuing education) within a six-month period after graduation. This 80.0% is used as a proxy for early career outcomes due to the lack of specific 2-year employment rate data.",
