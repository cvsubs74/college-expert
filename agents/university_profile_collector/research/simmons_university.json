Winning essays demonstrate leadership through specific actions within their community during challenging times, such as organizing clean-ups or assisting with food distribution during a pandemic. They also delve into personal struggles and how these experiences fueled their desire for education and change.",
      "Connect your interests to specific resources or academic opportunities at Simmons. Explicitly link your passions and future goals to what Simmons offers. One award-winning essay mentions a strong desire to engage in academic research in Sociology, specifically on \"increasing surveillance of marginalized populations and solutions to combat systemic racism, misogyny, homophobia, and xenophobia,\" demonstrating a clear alignment with potential academic pursuits at the university. This shows you've done your research and envision yourself thriving within their specific programs.",
      "Craft a clear narrative or driving purpose. While a Reddit thread specifically discusses this for a Physician Assistant program essay, the principle applies broadly: having a consistent \"main driving purpose\" for why you are applying to Simmons or a particular program can make your essay more cohesive and impactful. This narrative should weave through your experiences and aspirations, demonstrating what motivates you."
