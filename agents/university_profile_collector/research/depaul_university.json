      "transportation_impact": "DePaul University's location in Chicago significantly impacts campus life by integrating the city into the student experience. The university operates on two main campuses, one in downtown and another in Lincoln Park, with activities often planned to allow students sufficient time to travel between them via public transportation. For many, especially those transitioning from areas reliant on driving, the lifestyle involves a shift to public transportation and walking. The city itself is considered an extension of the campus, providing extensive opportunities for cultural experiences, internships, and social activities. A considerable portion of DePaul's student population, nearly 90%, commutes or lives off campus, highlighting the urban-integrated, rather than a traditional 'college town,' feel.",

The university hosts various platforms for students to showcase their work, including Undergraduate Research Showcases, the Undergraduate STEM Research Showcase, the Chicago Area Undergraduate Research Symposium (CAURS), and the BIG EAST Student Research Poster Symposium. DePaul also publishes peer-reviewed undergraduate research journals such as 'DePaul Discoveries' (College of Science and Health) and 'Creating Knowledge' (College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences). Several programs support student research, including the Summer Undergraduate Research Grant (SURG), Undergraduate Research Fund (URF), Undergraduate Research Assistant Program (URAP), and the Undergraduate Summer Research Program (USRP). The Jarvis College of Computing and Digital Media (CDM) specifically offers programs like the URAP and Motorola Solutions Foundation Scholars Program, providing hands-on experience and faculty collaboration. Furthermore, the university's location in Chicago facilitates access to thousands of internships and external research opportunities through resources like Handshake and partnerships such as the DePaul/Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science Summer Research Program."

    "alternate_major_strategy": "DePaul University offers flexibility for students exploring their academic paths, both during the application process and after enrollment. While explicit \"alternate major strategies\" with specific pairings (like \"CS in Engineering, list Cognitive Science as alternate\") are not detailed in general advisories, the university encourages applicants to list a second-choice major and provides clear pathways for internal transfers.\n\n### Alternate Major Strategies for Admission\n\nDePaul University's admissions process considers a second-choice major, particularly for competitive programs, without disadvantaging an applicant's primary selection. If an applicant isn't admitted to their first-choice major, their second choice will then be reviewed. This suggests that strategically choosing a backup major can increase the chances of admission to the university, even if the primary, highly competitive program is not immediately accessible. Applicants are encouraged to list a second choice, and this second choice can be within the same college as their first choice or in a different college.\n\nWhile specific strategic pairings are not provided, prospective students could consider the following:\n\n*   **Complementary Fields:** Choosing a second major in a related but less competitive field might leverage existing interests and preparation. For example, if a highly competitive STEM field is the first choice, a related major in the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences (LAS) or a broader science major in the College of Science and Health (CSH) could be a viable alternate.\n*   **Meeting College-Specific Requirements:** When listing a second major in a different college, it is crucial to understand and meet the admission requirements for that specific college. All admission requirements for each college where declared majors are located must be met, including any audition or portfolio requirements if applicable.\n\n### Changing Major After Admission (Internal Transfer)\n\nDePaul University provides a clear process for students to change their major or transfer between colleges after admission. This process is managed through the \"Declarations and Inter-College Transfer\" tool in Campus Connect.\n\n**Key aspects of changing majors or colleges internally include:**\n\n*   **Consulting an Advisor:** Students are strongly encouraged to meet with an academic advisor, particularly those in the Office for Academic Advising Support (OAAS), to explore academic options, understand requirements, and discuss the impact of a change on their degree progress and time to graduation. OAAS specifically assists undeclared students and those considering changing or adding a major or minor.\n*   **Eligibility for Inter-College Transfer:** To transfer to another college within DePaul, students must be currently enrolled or have been absent for no more than two consecutive quarters (excluding summer sessions), be in good academic standing, and have a minimum 2.000 DePaul GPA (a 2.500 GPA is required for transfer into the College of Education). Students must also have earned a minimum of 12 quarter hours as a degree-seeking student at DePaul, with those hours posted on their official transcript.\n*   **Impact on Scholarships:** While it's generally possible to retain scholarships when changing majors, it's advisable to confirm this with an admissions advisor or the OneDePaul office.\n*   **Time to Graduation:** Switching majors later in an academic career may cause a delay in graduation, making early consultation with an advisor beneficial.\n*   **What-If Degree Progress Report:** Before making an official change, students can run a a \"What-If Degree Progress Report\" in Campus Connect to see how a new major might impact their time to graduation.\n*   **Competitive Internal Transfer Process:** While DePaul is generally transfer-friendly, with transfer students making up a significant portion of its undergraduate population, certain majors, especially in fields like Computer Science, can be highly competitive. Some Reddit discussions indicate that attempting to \"game the system\" by applying to an \"easier\" major with the intent to transfer into a highly competitive one (like Computer Science) might not always be effective, as some schools make internal transfers into impacted majors difficult. However, other student experiences suggest that DePaul is generally flexible with internal transfers and major changes.\n\nFor transfer students specifically, DePaul evaluates applications holistically and recommends minimum cumulative GPAs for admission consideration to specific colleges (e.g., 2.0 for Liberal Arts & Social Sciences, Communication, Computing & Digital Media, and The Theatre School; 2.5 for Driehaus College of Business, College of Education, and School of Music). Transfer guides and counselors are also available to help plan course selections to best fit an intended DePaul major and ensure credit transfer.\n\nIn summary, DePaul provides a supportive environment for students to explore and change their academic paths. Strategic use of the second-choice major option during application and proactive engagement with academic advisors for internal transfers are key to successfully navigating academic goals at DePaul University."

This implies that sustained involvement and leadership in activities that align with an applicant's interests can be beneficial.",
