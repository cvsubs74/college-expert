It operates under the 'Wisconsin Idea,' emphasizing that its work should benefit people beyond campus boundaries.",
    "market_position": "Public Ivy",
    "admissions_philosophy": "University of Wisconsin-Madison employs a holistic review process for all applicants, where each application is thoroughly reviewed by at least two counselors without the use of formulas, charts, or AI. The review focuses on academic excellence, rigor of coursework, extracurricular involvement, essays, and letters of recommendation to understand the applicant's unique story and fit for the community. While test scores (SAT/ACT) can be submitted, the university is test-optional for undergraduate admissions.",

With over 800 student organizations, students have ample opportunities to find communities that align with their interests. There is a strong sense of school spirit, particularly around athletics like football, which includes active tailgating and pep rallies. The campus also has a robust Greek life and is known for its party scene. Popular social spots include the Memorial Union Terrace on Lake Mendota and State Street, which connects the State Capitol to campus, offering various eateries, shops, and cafes.",
      "transportation_impact": "Transportation at UW-Madison is designed for accessibility within the city of Madison. Students frequently rely on walking, biking, or the city bus system. UW students receive a bus pass for unlimited, free access to all city routes, and specific campus bus routes (80, 81, 82, 84) are fare-free for everyone. This integrated public transit system minimizes the need for personal vehicles on campus, contributing to a more pedestrian and bike-friendly environment. The Dane County Regional Airport is conveniently located and accessible via taxi or city bus for longer-distance travel.",
      "research_impact": "UW-Madison is a leading research institution, allocating over $1 billion annually to research across diverse fields from humanities to hard sciences. This strong research focus creates extensive opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in groundbreaking exploration. Programs such as the Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP), Hilldale Undergraduate/Faculty Research Fellowships, Holstrom Environmental Research Fellowship, Undergraduate Research Scholars (URS) program, and Wisconsin Idea Undergraduate Fellowships allow students to work with faculty mentors, assist in ongoing projects, or design their own research, often with opportunities for funding or academic credit. The university's commitment to research is central to the 'Wisconsin Idea,' aiming to improve lives beyond campus boundaries."
