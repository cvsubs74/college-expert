    "major_selection_tactics": [
      "Here are several strategies for choosing a major strategically at St. Louis University (SLU):\n\n*   **Utilize SLU's Major Exploration Resources**: SLU offers extensive support for students who are undecided or want to explore different academic paths. This includes academic advisors who can help you identify majors aligned with your interests, strengths, and career goals, as well as online assessment tools from Career Services. You can also meet with faculty members to gain insights into specific academic programs.\n\n*   **Consider \"Still Deciding\" as an Option**: Many students enter SLU unsure of their major, and the university supports this by providing resources for major exploration. The College of Arts and Sciences, for instance, offers versatility for students to explore academic pathways before officially declaring a major. About a third of students change majors at least once, indicating flexibility in the process.\n\n*   **Be Aware of Major-Specific Requirements and Direct Entry Programs**: While many general programs have a straightforward application process, some majors, such as Nursing or Physical Therapy, may have specific requirements or necessitate direct application as a freshman. For example, Nursing students are admitted as freshmen and begin major-relevant courses in their first year. Physical Therapy programs also often require application as a freshman with additional requirements.\n\n*   **Align Your Major with Your Passions and Skills (Vocation Discernment)**: SLU encourages students to reflect on what brings them joy, what they are good at, and what needs society has. This \"vocation discernment\" approach, often discussed with academic advisors and faculty, can help you find a major that truly aligns with your personal talents and societal impact.\n\n*   **Gain Experience Through Internships and Campus Activities**: Engage in internships and campus organizations to test out potential interests. Internships can provide hands-on experience in fields related to your potential major, and SLU's career center can assist with connections. Campus activities can also offer clues about your interests and what you want to pursue."

    "alternate_major": {
      "alternate_major_strategy": "While St. Louis University emphasizes flexibility and support for major exploration after admission, if applying to a highly competitive program, students may consider applying to a broader or less restrictive major, particularly within the College of Arts and Sciences which offers a wide range of options and versatility. Students are then encouraged to utilize academic advisors, career services, and campus resources to explore interests and facilitate a major change if desired.",
      "internal_transfer_difficulty": "Internal transfer into certain highly competitive or specialized programs, such as accelerated B.S.N., occupational therapy, physical therapy, and aeronautics, may be more challenging due to specific deadlines and potential additional requirements. However, changing majors generally involves meeting with an academic advisor and completing a Major Application Form, with support systems in place to assist students."
