Programs like QB3-Berkeley internships provide invaluable real-world experience, positioning graduates for success in cutting-edge industries.",
            "**Debunking the 'Socially Dead' Myth**: While some perceive Berkeley as intensely academic, the 'socially dead' stereotype is often refuted by students. The campus fosters a 'work hard, play hard' culture with a plethora of clubs and activities, though students may need to be proactive in finding their niche.",
            "**Exceptional Urban Connectivity**: Located in Berkeley, CA, the campus benefits from excellent public transportation, including its own shuttle system (Bear Transit), extensive bus lines (AC Transit), and regional rapid transit (BART). This connectivity enhances student mobility both on and off campus, providing access to the broader Bay Area.",
            "**Focus on Return on Investment**: Forbes' high ranking (5th overall, 1st public) highlights Berkeley's strong outcomes for graduates in terms of return on investment and career achievements, reflecting its success in preparing students for influential and high-earning careers with comparatively low student debt."

The Bear Transit shuttle system serves the campus and vicinity, including residence halls, and connects to Downtown Berkeley BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit). Students can utilize an EasyPass for unlimited rides on AC Transit buses and Bear Transit shuttles (excluding the RFS line). Biking and scooter use are encouraged on campus, with dedicated lanes and parking. The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system provides extensive access throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, with three stations in Berkeley.",

The California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3-Berkeley) partners with local biotech companies to offer paid summer internships for undergraduates. The university hosts numerous undergraduate research programs, including Amgen Scholars, NSF Center programs, and various departmental research experiences across STEM fields (e.g., engineering, biology, computer science). Undergraduates are encouraged to join research groups, often pairing with graduate students, and can receive course credit for extracurricular research through programs like URAP."

            "For majors in the College of Letters & Science (L&S), students are often admitted undeclared, except for high-demand majors. The choice of major in L&S generally does not affect admission chances directly, but your extracurriculars should align with your stated interests.",

            "The prompt's example of 'Engineers should pick Warren over Revelle' refers to a multi-campus UC strategy (UC San Diego colleges), not specific to UC Berkeley's internal colleges. Within UC Berkeley, the strategy revolves around selecting the most suitable college and major(s) based on your genuine interests and academic profile, while being mindful of the varying competitiveness."

        "alternate_major_strategy": "UC Berkeley only guarantees review of the primary major; alternate majors are considered secondarily, usually during the waitlist process if space is available. If you list an alternate major, it should ideally be somewhat related to your primary major but perhaps less competitive or less impacted, and you should have genuine interest and experience in it. For applicants to the College of Letters & Science, 'Undeclared' is a valid option for either primary or alternate major and does not impact chances of admission. Students interested in highly competitive L&S majors (e.g., Data Science) who don't select them as primary, and are admitted to a different L&S major, will face a comprehensive review process to switch, rather than just GPA requirements, and have only one opportunity to apply to the high-demand major. If your main goal is admission to UC Berkeley and you are applying to a highly selective primary major (e.g., Engineering), selecting a non-selective major as an alternate might increase your chances of admission to the university itself, though it doesn't guarantee your desired major later."

        "philosophy": "The University of California, Berkeley generally offers academic credit for various external examinations and prior coursework, aiming to allow students to fulfill specific subject, general education, or language requirements. While credits can provide flexibility in academic planning, they do not typically reduce the total number of units required for graduation or compel students to declare a major earlier. A duplication policy ensures that credit is awarded only once for the same content, whether from multiple exams or a combination of exam and college course credit.",
        "ap_policy": {
            "General rule": "UC Berkeley awards unit credits for Advanced Placement (AP) exam scores of 3, 4, or 5. These are typically expressed in semester units.",
            "Exceptions": "Not all AP exams are approved for unit credits, and credit is not awarded for scores below 3. However, scores below 3 do not negatively impact admission chances. If an AP exam duplicates a college course or another exam in the same content area, credit is awarded only once, usually for the higher transfer credit value.",
            "Usage": "AP credits can satisfy specific subject requirements, general education requirements (also known as breadth requirements), or language requirements. For example, a score of 3 or higher on history exams can earn three semester units toward breadth requirements, and a qualifying score on Calculus AB or BC can earn credit for Mathematics 1A or both 1A and 1B, respectively. Similarly, certain AP English Literature and Composition scores can satisfy Reading & Composition requirements. AP credits do not count toward the maximum units required for declaring a major or the maximum units a student may accumulate prior to graduation."

        "ib_policy": {
            "HL vs SL treatment": "UC Berkeley awards unit credits for International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level (HL) exams with scores of 5, 6, or 7. Credit is not granted for Standard Level (SL) examinations.",
            "Diploma bonus": "Students who complete the IB diploma with a score of 30 or above receive an additional 6 quarter units (equivalent to 4 semester units) toward their UC degree, in addition to the units earned for individual Higher Level exams.",
            "Usage": "Students receive 8 quarter units (approximately 5.3 semester units) per eligible Higher Level exam. These units are considered elective and may be applied to UC graduation requirements for specific subjects and/or for general education/breadth requirements, as determined by each campus. IB HL exams with scores of 5 or higher can also meet portions of the seven-course pattern for transfer students, though not the English composition requirements. As with AP, if an IB exam duplicates another exam or a college course, credit is awarded only once."

        "transfer_articulation": {
            "Tools used": "UC Berkeley utilizes ASSIST.org as the primary online resource for students transferring from California community colleges. This system articulates which community college courses are equivalent to UC Berkeley courses and are eligible for transfer credit. Students are advised to consult both their community college and UC Berkeley counselors to ensure they are on the correct path.",
            "Unit caps and restrictions": "A maximum of 70 lower-division transfer units from other higher education institutions (excluding UC coursework) may be applied toward the 120-unit minimum required for graduation. This limit does not apply to exam units. Transfer credit does not satisfy UC Berkeley's residence requirements, including senior residence and major residence. Credit will not be awarded for a transfer course if a comparable UC Berkeley course has already been completed with a passing grade, or if the transfer course represents a lower level of study after a higher-level course. Completing the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) is crucial for meeting lower-division general education/breadth requirements before transferring.
