This major is often housed in a college like Arts or Business, depending on the university's structure. CSUF lists a B.A. in Business Administration with an Entertainment and Hospitality Management concentration, which is housed in the College of Business and Economics. For this response, I'm assuming a B.S. in Entertainment and Hospitality Management under the College of the Arts, but it might be a B.A. under Business or an interdisciplinary program at CSUF. Given limited direct access to the 2025-2026 CSUF specific catalog for all majors, this is a reasonable interpretation of program offerings."

    "major_selection_tactics": [
      "Here are several strategies for choosing a major strategically when applying to California State University, Fullerton (CSUF):\n\n1.  **Research Major-Specific Impaction and Admission Criteria:** CSUF is an impacted campus, which means all undergraduate programs, including undeclared, receive more applications from qualified students than available spaces. This results in competitive admissions, and supplemental criteria are often used. Therefore, it's crucial to research the specific admission requirements and any additional criteria (like GPA in prerequisite courses) for each major of interest before applying. Some programs, such as Nursing, Dance, and Music, have distinct application processes or audition requirements, and it is typically not possible to change into the Nursing major after initial admission.\n\n2.  **Consider Applying to a Less Competitive Major if Your Top Choice is Highly Impacted:** While CSUF does not officially publish a list of \"easier\" majors, some fields are generally perceived as less competitive than others. If you are not singularly set on highly competitive programs like Computer Science or certain Engineering disciplines, applying to a major in a field like the Liberal Arts or some Humanities programs might offer a relatively better chance of admission, assuming you meet their specific impaction criteria. Popular majors at CSUF include Business, Psychology, and Communications. This strategy is about finding a balance between your interests and the statistical likelihood of admission.\n\n3.  **Utilize the Undeclared Option for Major Exploration (with caution):** CSUF offers an undeclared option with support from the Undeclared and Academic Advising Center (UAAC) to help students explore their interests. However, it's important to remember that even the undeclared status is impacted. If admitted as undeclared, students are generally required to declare a major by the time they complete 60 units. For specific pathways like \"Engineering - Undeclared,\" students must declare a major within the College of Engineering and Computer Science before their third semester. This path is viable for students genuinely undecided but should not be seen as a guaranteed back door into a highly impacted major that typically requires direct admission.\n\n4.  **Understand the Change of Major Process and its Limitations:** While changing your major at CSUF is possible, especially once enrolled, it's not a simple or guaranteed process for impacted programs. You typically need to complete a Major/Minor Change Form, and for many impacted majors, you'll need to meet specific departmental requirements, such as maintaining a certain GPA in prerequisite courses, and obtain departmental approval. There may also be a fee for changing your major after the first declaration. Therefore, applying directly to your intended major, even if competitive, is generally recommended over hoping to transfer into it later, especially for highly impacted programs where direct admission is often the only path."
    ],
    "college_ranking_tactics": [],
    "alternate_major_strategy": "California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) does not consider alternate majors for admission for either freshman or transfer applicants. \n\n**Advice on Selecting a Major for Admission:**\n\nSince CSUF does not use alternate majors, applicants should apply directly to the major they are most interested in and qualified for. Admission to CSUF is competitive due to its impacted status, meaning more qualified applicants apply than can be admitted. This applies to the campus as a whole and specific majors. Freshman applicants are evaluated based on a Multi-Factor Admission Score (MFAS), and meeting minimum CSU requirements does not guarantee admission.\n\nFor those interested in engineering but undecided on a specific discipline, CSUF offers an \"Engineering - Undeclared\" option for freshman applicants. Students admitted through this program receive advising to explore their interests and must declare a specific engineering major before their third semester.\n\n**Internal Transfer Difficulty (Changing Major After Admission):**\n\nChanging majors after admission, especially into an impacted program, can be challenging and competitive at CSUF.\n\n*   **Timing Restrictions:** Newly admitted students must generally wait until the first day of the semester to request a major change. A change of major is not permitted after an applicant submits an application for fall or spring consideration, meaning the major they are accepted into must be their major until the first day of classes.\n*   **Meeting Requirements:** Students will be unable to switch into an impacted major without meeting the specific GPA and other requirements for that major. For some colleges, like the College of Business and Economics, students initially enter as a pre-major (e.g., Pre-Business) and must complete lower-division core courses with a \"C\" or higher before declaring a specific concentration. Changing from a non-business major to a business major often requires meeting with a business advisor first.\n*   **Formal Process:** Changing a major typically involves filling out a Major/Minor Change Form, which may require departmental approval and can take time to process. A fee may also be associated with the change.\n*   **Advising:** The university emphasizes the importance of academic advising. Undeclared students are advised by the Academic Advisement Center and must declare a major before completing 60 units. Students interested in exploring different majors or changing their current one are encouraged to seek advising.",

A maximum of 70 units from community colleges will be accepted towards a baccalaureate degree. While courses beyond this 70-unit limit may satisfy major requirements, the units themselves will not count towards the overall degree unit count. Furthermore, upper-division credit is not granted for courses completed at a community college. CSUF also does not accept lower-division transfers, requiring a minimum of 60 transferable semester units for admission. For courses with \"Credit\" or \"Pass\" grades taken outside of the Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall 2020 and Winter, Spring, or Summer 2021 terms, the transcript legend or institutional catalog must indicate an equivalence of a C- or better for transferability. While there are no limits to the number of units accepted for Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) test credits, other forms of credit by examination, such as CLEP, are limited to 30 units. CSUF also grants up to 30 units of credit for prior learning."
