    "alternate_major_strategy": "The search results do not explicitly indicate that the University of Alabama's undergraduate application allows for the selection of a primary and a secondary/alternate major during the initial application process. Once an application is submitted, changes generally cannot be made to the declared major. Therefore, if a student is applying to a highly competitive major, the strategy would likely involve applying directly to their desired major and, if admission to that specific program is a concern, understanding the process for changing majors *after* admission. The University of Alabama demonstrates a flexible environment for students wishing to change their major once enrolled. Roughly half of undergraduate students change their majors at least once, with the first two years being the most common time for such changes to avoid delaying graduation. To declare or change a major within the College of Arts and Sciences, students can log into myBama and follow the 'change of curriculum' link. For changes to a major in a different college, such as the Culverhouse College of Business, students must contact the advising office of the intended college. Consulting with an academic advisor is strongly recommended before making a formal change, as they can help ensure the new major aligns with academic and career goals and assess its impact on the graduation timeline. Resources like the Career Center and a majors fair hosted each fall are available to help students explore different fields of study. While the university generally facilitates major changes, the ease of internal transfer can vary, particularly for competitive or 'impacted' majors. Discussions suggest that majors such as Business, Computer Science, Engineering, and Nursing can be among the hardest to switch into at many schools, and this often holds true at Alabama. The difficulty often stems from such majors being housed in separate, often more competitive, colleges with their own specific admission requirements for internal transfers. For instance, transferring into a major within the Culverhouse College of Business or the College of Engineering may involve specific GPA requirements or course prerequisites that need to be met. It is advisable for students interested in these fields to speak with advisors in the respective colleges to understand any specific internal transfer requirements or limitations."
