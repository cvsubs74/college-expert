    "admissions_philosophy": "Binghamton seeks intellectually curious and highly motivated students who have demonstrated strong academic performance and a commitment to engaging with the campus community. A holistic review process considers GPA, test scores (if submitted), essay quality, extracurricular involvement, and potential for contribution to the university's diverse environment.",

Self-reported SAT scores are accepted, but official scores are required upon enrollment. For transfer students, test scores are optional if they have completed fewer than 24 semester credits or 36 quarter credits since high school graduation. International students may submit ACT/SAT scores for academic review or to fulfill English proficiency requirements, though other tests are also accepted for English proficiency.

These are generally considered \"easiest to get into\". You can often transfer internally or declare a desired major later, especially within Harpur, once admitted to the university.",
      "Consider applying undeclared within Harpur College of Arts and Sciences: Harpur College is the largest and most diverse, offering over 60 Bachelor's degree programs. Applying undeclared to Harpur can be a viable strategy, as it's generally one of the easier schools to get into. Once enrolled, students have opportunities to explore various fields through introductory classes, clubs, and career development resources before declaring a major, typically during their second year.",
      "Leverage the Binghamton University Scholars Program for guaranteed major choice: If you are accepted into the Binghamton University Scholars Program, you are granted the privilege of choosing any major in any school or college at Binghamton. This guarantees admission to your desired major, provided you apply no later than March 10 of your first year and seek advice from the relevant advising office.",
      "Research major-specific admission requirements and competitiveness before applying: Some programs at Binghamton are highly competitive, such as those in the Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science, the Decker College of Nursing and Health Sciences, and the School of Management (SOM). If you are aiming for one of these, it's crucial to have a strong academic record, particularly in relevant coursework (e.g., high grades in math and science for engineering). Understanding the specific prerequisites and average accepted GPAs or test scores for your target major can significantly inform your application strategy.",
      "Excel in target major-related courses and highlight relevant experiences: For competitive majors, demonstrating strong performance in subjects related to your desired field is important. Additionally, extracurricular activities, volunteer work, and strong recommendations can enhance your application, as Binghamton takes a holistic approach to admissions. This is especially true if your GPA or test scores are not at the very top, as these elements can showcase your character and commitment to your chosen field."

      "Align your academic choice with personal interests and career goals. Students are advised to explore different majors and programs by taking introductory classes to fulfill general education requirements, assessing their enjoyment of the material, and considering how the learning applies to potential careers. Utilizing resources like academic advisors and the Fleishman Center for Career and Professional Development can help evaluate options and narrow down interests.",
      "Evaluate the specific academic environment and resources of each school or program. Consider factors such as emphasis on interdisciplinary studies, research opportunities (like the Freshman Research Immersion program for STEM students), availability of specialized clinics or facilities, and the overall academic rigor and support services offered (e.g., tutoring, writing centers).",
      "Consider the characteristics of the residential communities. Binghamton University has a residential college system with six distinct communities. Students can evaluate these based on factors such as convenience to campus facilities, room quality, availability of amenities like air conditioning, and the social atmosphere or \"spirit\" of each community. For example, Dickinson Community is often noted for its convenience and spacious rooms, while College-In-the-Woods is recognized for its charm and central location."
