    "executive_summary": "The University of San Diego (USD) is a private Catholic research university known for its 'Changemaker' identity, fostering academic excellence and a commitment to creating sustainable solutions locally and globally. It offers a comprehensive liberal arts education within a vibrant urban campus setting, emphasizing ethical leadership and social impact.",
    "market_position": "Elite Private",
    "admissions_philosophy": "The University of San Diego employs a holistic review process for undergraduate admissions, considering academic performance (average admitted GPA around 3.8), personal essays, letters of recommendation, and extracurricular involvement. The university has adopted a test-free admission policy for Fall 2026 and Spring 2026 applicants, and utilizes the Common Application.",

        "category": "Selectivity",
        "insight": "With an acceptance rate of 47% and an average admitted GPA of 3.8, USD is a selective institution. The test-free policy for upcoming cycles may broaden the applicant pool, emphasizing non-numerical aspects of applications.",
        "implication": "Prospective students should focus on crafting strong essays and securing impactful recommendations, alongside maintaining a competitive GPA, to stand out in the selective admissions process."

        "category": "Distinctive Identity",
        "insight": "USD's self-identification as a 'Changemaker' campus and its high ranking in 'Best Schools for Making an Impact' indicate a strong institutional focus on social responsibility and global engagement.",
        "implication": "Applicants with a demonstrated commitment to service, social justice, and making a positive impact will likely find a strong fit and may wish to highlight these aspects in their application materials."

    ],
    "campus_dynamics": {
      "social_environment": "The University of San Diego fosters a 'tight-knit community' due to its smaller campus size, encouraging active involvement in a wide array of student organizations and community activities. As a 'Changemaker' campus, the social environment emphasizes connection, leadership development, helping others, and exploring diverse perspectives. While the party scene is noted as 'not the greatest,' the campus is in proximity to other social venues and San Diego State University. Approximately 8% of men are in fraternities and 15% of women are in sororities.",
      "transportation_impact": "Transportation at USD is well-supported, minimizing the need for personal vehicles for on-campus and local travel. The free USD Tram Service provides convenient access throughout campus and to the Old Town Transit Center, which serves as a hub for the San Diego Trolley, local bus service (MTS Route #44), and the North County Coaster. This robust public transit network connects students to the greater San Diego area. On-campus parking is available but requires permits, and Zip Cars offer additional flexibility.",
      "research_impact": "As an 'R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity' institution, the University of San Diego provides significant research opportunities for its students. The Office of Undergraduate Research offers funded research experiences, workshops, and resources to students from all backgrounds. Key programs include the STARBURST Scholars Program, Beckman Scholars Program, McNair Scholars Program, Keck Undergraduate Humanities Research Fellows, and the Catalyst Research First Program for first-generation students. This focus on research, coupled with its 'Changemaker' ethos, allows students to engage in practical applications of knowledge and contribute to impactful projects."
