      "Show, don't tell: Use concrete examples, stories, and detailed descriptions to illustrate your qualities and experiences, rather than simply stating them.",

The essay should be authentic and reflect your unique experiences.",
      "Incomplete or Falsified Information: Providing an incomplete application or omitting/falsifying information, particularly regarding disciplinary history, can lead to denial or rescission of admission. Accuracy and completeness are crucial.",
      "Weak or Generic Letters of Recommendation: While Adelphi requires letters of recommendation, submitting those that are weak or come from individuals who do not know you well can detract from your application. These letters are an opportunity for others to highlight your strengths and potential.",
      "Procrastination and Missing Deadlines: Waiting until the last minute to submit your application is a common mistake and can be detrimental, potentially impacting your consideration for scholarships or admission on a space-available basis. Adelphi encourages early application, especially for early action and competitive programs."
