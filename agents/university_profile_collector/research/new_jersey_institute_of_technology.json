These research programs are supported by both internal and external funding, including National Science Foundation (NSF) grants for Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) sites. Examples include REU programs in Space Weather Sciences, which offer stipends, travel, meals, and accommodation for students engaged in solar physics, space weather, and big data research, and another REU site focused on computational data analytics. The university also encourages interdisciplinary collaborative research with industry and business partners to address global challenges. Facilities like the New Jersey Innovation Acceleration Center (NJIAC) and the National Academy of Inventors (NAI) NJIT Chapter further support students and faculty in translational research, technology development, intellectual property, and entrepreneurial ventures."

These include earning a minimum number of credits at NJIT (e.g., 12 credits after the first semester or 24 credits after the first year), maintaining a certain cumulative GPA (e.g., 3.0 or 2.5), and achieving specific grades in core courses like Calculus I and Physics I (e.g., 'B' or better, or 'C' or better).

These credits can contribute towards an NJIT degree, potentially exempting students from certain introductory courses and satisfying some major prerequisites or general education requirements.\n\nHowever, there are specific exceptions to this general rule:\n*   Some subjects, such as Chemistry, require a score of 5 to receive a higher number of credits or for more advanced course equivalencies. For example, a score of 4 in Chemistry grants 4 credits (CHEM 125 and 125A), while a score of 5 grants 8 credits (CHEM 125, 125A, and 126).\n*   Similarly, for AP Calculus BC, a score of 5 is typically needed to receive credit for both Calculus I and II (MATH 111 and MATH 112), totaling 8 credits. A score of 4 may only grant credit for Calculus I or equivalent (MATH 111 or MATH 113/135/138).\n*   While not explicitly detailed in the main AP credit policy chart, some sources indicate that Studio Art: Drawing may also require a score of 5.\n*   AP Computer Science A, AP Computer Science Principles, and AP Research are not explicitly listed with credit equivalencies in NJIT's detailed AP policy chart. This suggests that credit for these exams may not be automatically granted or might be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAP credits at NJIT are used to provide incoming students with college credits prior to starting classes, allowing for potential placement into advanced courses.",

Credit is not typically awarded for Standard Level (SL) courses.\n\n**Diploma Bonus:**\nThe available information does not indicate any explicit extra benefits or additional credit awarded for completing the full IB Diploma.
