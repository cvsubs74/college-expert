Greek life is also present and can be a way to meet people. [cite: 15, 16, 18, 19, first search output]",
      "transportation_impact": "LMU is proactive in promoting alternative transportation to reduce single-occupancy vehicle trips. The university offers a complimentary shuttle service between its campuses (Westchester and Playa Vista) and to downtown Los Angeles, connecting students to public transportation hubs. Additionally, students have access to car-sharing programs (ZipCar), public transportation partnerships (LA Metro U-Pass, BBB bus fares), and carpooling initiatives. This diverse range of options mitigates the need for personal vehicles on a daily basis, but students may still utilize personal cars or ride-sharing for off-campus excursions.

      "research_impact": "As a 'High Research Activity (R2)' institution, LMU strongly supports undergraduate and graduate research. This commitment fosters an environment where students can collaborate with faculty on academic research, providing hands-on learning and preparing them for advanced studies. Programs like the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP), Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP), and the Rains Research Assistant Program offer financial and mentorship support. The presence of 19 interdisciplinary research centers and institutes further enhances opportunities for students to engage with pressing societal issues and contribute to knowledge creation.

Be aware that some universities do not guarantee review of alternate majors or make internal transfers to highly demanded majors extremely difficult. Applying undeclared might be a viable alternate for some Letters and Science colleges, but for engineering fields, it's often better to apply directly to the desired specific major."
