UT calculates this GPA on a 4-point scale, using unweighted high school course grades as the basis for these weightings. If a high school does not weigh courses, UT will also not weigh them. The core GPA is a significant factor for admission eligibility, scholarships, and honors program participation. The University of Tennessee employs a competitive and holistic admissions process, considering academic performance alongside other factors like curriculum rigor, extracurriculars, essays, and test scores. For Tennessee residents, guaranteed admission is offered to those who have a 4.0+ UT Core GPA or are in the top 10% of their high school graduating class. While the average unweighted GPA for applicants is 4.0, the 25th and 75th percentiles for unweighted GPA are not disclosed."
