    "executive_summary": "UC Davis is a highly-ranked public research university located in Davis, California, known for its strong programs in agricultural sciences, veterinary medicine, and biological sciences. It offers a vibrant academic environment with a focus on undergraduate research and diverse transportation options, though its social scene is often debated by students.",
    "market_position": "Public Ivy",
    "admissions_philosophy": "UC Davis emphasizes a holistic review process, especially evident in its graduate admissions which require essays, letters of recommendation, and transcripts, and often a writing sample for specific programs. While specific undergraduate philosophy details weren't explicitly found, the competitive acceptance rate (42% in some reports) and essay requirements for UC applications generally point towards a comprehensive evaluation of applicants beyond just test scores.",

      "social_environment": "The 'socially dead' myth at UC Davis is often debated. While some students note a quieter scene compared to 'party schools,' many agree that the social life is what you make of it. Clubs, Greek life, house parties, and downtown bars offer opportunities for engagement. The presence of a vibrant downtown with bars, art galleries, and trivia nights provides alternative social outlets. Some perceive a shift in social dynamics post-COVID, with less spontaneous interaction.",
      "transportation_impact": "UC Davis is renowned for its bike-friendly campus and city, with extensive bike paths and parking. The student-operated Unitrans bus system provides free transportation for undergraduates throughout Davis, with routes to shopping centers and on-campus terminals. The Yolobus, also free for UC Davis students, connects Davis with Woodland and Sacramento, including the Sacramento International Airport. The Causeway Connection links the Davis campus with the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. Safe Rides offer a free service for students needing rides at night. This comprehensive transportation network reduces reliance on personal cars, mitigating parking stress and promoting sustainability.",
      "research_impact": "UC Davis is a 'STEM powerhouse' with strong ties to biotechnology, offering 39 biotech-related undergraduate majors and minors. Undergraduates are highly encouraged to pursue independent research, with resources like the Undergraduate Research Center. Research opportunities exist in numerous on-campus centers (e.g., California National Primate Research Center) and faculty labs across various departments, including Biomedical Engineering, Animal Science, and Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine. Alumni find employment with major biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like Genentech and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, as well as at other University of California campuses."

      "general_rule": "UC Davis grants transfer credit for each College Board Advanced Placement (AP) examination completed with an official score of 3, 4, or 5. Students receive 2, 4, or 8 units of credit towards graduation based on their scores.",
      "exceptions": "A maximum of 8 quarter units is awarded for both Language & Composition and Literature & Composition exams. For Physics, a maximum of 8 quarter units is awarded for all four exams combined (Physics 1, Physics 2, Physics C: Mechanics, and Physics C: Electricity & Magnetism). Similarly, a maximum of 8 quarter units applies to all three Art & Design exams. If a student duplicates an exam with another exam of the same subject content (e.g., AP and IB in the same subject) or with a college course, credit is awarded only once.",
      "usage": "AP credit contributes to the minimum 180 quarter units required for a bachelor's degree. While AP credit may satisfy specific degree requirements or grant course equivalency for lower-division courses, it generally cannot be used to satisfy the campus General Education (GE) requirements, with potential exceptions for the English Composition component of the Literacy with Words and Images requirement. AP credit earned before entering the university does not count toward maximum unit limitations for major selection or graduation. Students are advised to consult with an academic advisor regarding the application of AP credit to breadth requirements and lower-division major courses."

    "ib_policy": {
      "hl_vs_sl_treatment": "UC Davis awards 8 quarter units of credit for individual International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level (HL) exams with scores of 5, 6, or 7. The university does not grant credit for Standard Level (SL) exams, although a score of 6 or higher on an SL exam can satisfy the university Entry Level Writing Requirement without awarding course credit.",
      "diploma_bonus": "Students who complete the IB diploma with a score of 30 or above will receive an additional 6 quarter units (effective S20), in addition to the units earned for individual Higher Level exams. For Fall 2020 applicants and onwards, this diploma bonus is stated as 4 semester/6 quarter units. The maximum combined credit for the IB diploma and individual HL exams can be up to 30 quarter units."

    "transfer_articulation": {
      "tools_used": "For California Community College (CCC) courses, articulation information is available and considered final through ASSIST.org. For coursework from four-year colleges/universities and out-of-state two-year institutions, the Transfer Evaluation System (TES) is used, and transfer equivalency decisions are made by UC Davis faculty experts.",
      "unit_caps_and_restrictions": "Students must complete at least 60 semester or 90 quarter UC transferable units by the end of the spring term prior to fall enrollment. A minimum GPA of 2.80 in UC-transferable courses is required for admission (2.40 for UC requirements, 2.80 for non-residents). Students should not take more than 14 semester (21 quarter) Pass/No Pass units, though courses taken P/NP in Winter, Spring, and Summer 2020 due to COVID-19 are exempt from this limit. All community college courses transfer as lower-division credit, and cannot replace upper-division UC Davis courses. Transfer credit, once evaluated and posted, cannot be removed at the student's request. Final determination of transferability for non-California Community College coursework is made after review of official transcripts."
