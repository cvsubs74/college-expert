      "Generic or Uninspired Essays: The University of Oklahoma reviews personal essays, and some programs may even require them. A generic essay that lacks personal insight or doesn't clearly demonstrate your interest in OU can be a missed opportunity to stand out.",
      "Listing Activities Without Depth or Impact: While extracurricular activities are important for showcasing your interests and commitments, simply listing them without elaborating on your meaningful involvement, leadership, or the impact you've made can be a red flag.",
      "Submitting Poor or Uninformative Letters of Recommendation (if applicable): Although letters of recommendation may be optional, if you choose to submit them, ensure they are from teachers or counselors who know you well and can speak genuinely about your strengths and character. Vague or unenthusiastic letters can fail to enhance your application.",
      "Incomplete or Inaccurate Application Information: Failing to provide all required official documents, such as transcripts, or inaccurately reporting academic history (e.g., not listing all colleges attended) can lead to delays in admission processing, denial, or even rescission of admission."
