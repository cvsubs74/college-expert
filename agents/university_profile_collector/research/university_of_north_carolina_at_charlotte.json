While some students express concerns about campus spirit and a 'commuter nature' that can affect engagement, many appreciate the sense of belonging and the wide array of clubs and organizations available.

For highly competitive majors like Architecture, Business, Computer Science, and Engineering, which have additional admission requirements (e.g., higher GPAs, specific prerequisite courses, portfolios, or interviews), it can be challenging to gain direct admission. An inferred alternate major strategy for applicants to competitive programs would be to consider applying to a less competitive, related major, or even as 'undeclared,' if direct admission to the first-choice competitive major is uncertain. This approach allows students to gain admission to the university and then work towards meeting the internal transfer requirements for their desired program.; internal_transfer_difficulty: {'competitive_majors': 'Majors such as Architecture, Computer Science, and various Engineering programs have stringent requirements for internal transfers, including minimum cumulative GPAs and successful completion of specific prerequisite courses. For instance, Architecture requires a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.25, an additional application, and a portfolio. Computer Science generally requires a 2.5 or higher cumulative GPA and a grade of C or higher in all previously attempted Computer Science courses.', 'advising_recommendation': 'Students interested in changing to a competitive major are strongly encouraged to work with academic advisors early to understand the specific eligibility criteria and the change of major process.'}; change_major_after_admission_process: {'new_students_before_enrollment': \"Students can request to change their major on the admissions application by emailing admissions@uncc.edu or through the 'Update My Major' button in their Future 49er Portal.\", 'current_students': 'Within the same college: Contact current Academic Advisor.
