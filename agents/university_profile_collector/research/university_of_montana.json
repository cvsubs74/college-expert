Many departments actively engage undergraduates in research, such as Biological Sciences, Neuroscience, Wildlife Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences. Students have options to work on faculty research projects for pay or course credit, or to initiate their own projects under faculty guidance. Specialized summer research programs and fellowships are also available through various centers and stations, including the Flathead Lake Biological Station, Center for Structural and Functional Neuroscience, Center for Environmental Health Sciences, and Center for Translational Medicine. The UM Conference on Undergraduate Research (UMCUR) provides a platform for students to present their scholarly and creative work."

While overall admission is not highly selective, some specialized programs may have separate, more rigorous application procedures *after* initial university admission. For example, the Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree requires prerequisite art classes and a portfolio review for program application during the sophomore year. Similarly, the Pharmacy (PharmD) program, while considered \"easier than some\" by one applicant, is still competitive with around 140-200 applicants for small class sizes. The School of Business, however, was noted as having a clear and not difficult application process for program admission after meeting general education course requirements.",
      "Consider starting undeclared if unsure, especially within the College of Humanities & Sciences. The University of Montana offers a \"Multidisciplinary Studies B.A.\" and various interdisciplinary programs, allowing flexibility. For students who are not yet set on a specific major, the high general acceptance rate and the availability of diverse academic areas within colleges like Humanities & Sciences could allow them to enter undeclared and explore options before committing to a specific program.",
      "Leverage the test-optional policy. The University of Montana is test-optional, meaning students may apply without submitting standardized test scores.

While university-wide graduation rates for the University of Montana are available (e.g., approximately 31% for 4-year graduation), students should ideally seek out or inquire about graduation rates specific to the individual colleges or academic programs they are considering.

Credits from remedial, technical, or continuing education courses or from non-accredited schools are not accepted for transfer. Associate of Arts (AA) and Associate of Science (AS) degrees from regionally accredited US colleges satisfy lower-division General Education requirements, but Associate of Applied Science (AAS) Degrees do not necessarily satisfy all lower-division General Education requirements. Quarter credits are converted to semester credits (quarter units divided by 1.5 = semester units)."

      "Make it personal and reveal your personality. Your essay should serve as a replacement for a face-to-face interview, reflecting who you are, your values, and what makes you interesting and different from other applicants. Avoid simply repeating information found elsewhere in your application.",
      "Show, don't just tell, through specific anecdotes and examples. Instead of just stating qualities, use concrete experiences and stories that illuminate your achievements, experiences, and vision for the future.",
      "Connect your interests to specific resources, programs, or aspects of the University of Montana. Research the university thoroughly and mention particular classes, professors, clubs, activities, or unique features of the campus or community (like Missoula's outdoor opportunities) that appeal to you and explain why they are a good fit for your goals and aspirations.",
      "Avoid clichés and generic statements. While some clichés are acceptable if genuine, strive for originality and infuse your unique personality. Focus on writing naturally and genuinely, and the uniqueness will follow."
