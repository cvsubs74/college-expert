    "alternate_major_strategy": "Kansas State University offers several pathways and considerations for students exploring alternate majors, both during the initial application process and for those looking to change their focus after admission.\n\n### Alternate Major Strategy During Application\n\nWhile K-State does not explicitly detail a \"backup major\" selection on its primary application, students applying to competitive programs may consider applying as \"undeclared\" or through the \"Exploratory Studies\" program. This approach allows students to enter the university without being locked into a specific, highly selective major upfront.\n\n*   **Exploratory Studies:** Kansas State University offers an Exploratory Studies program for students who are undecided about their major or wish to explore different academic areas before committing. This can serve as an alternate strategy, allowing students more time to discover their best fit major while completing general education requirements. Advisors in Exploratory Studies can assist students in navigating their interests and making informed decisions about their academic path. Students are generally required to declare a major and move out of Exploratory by the time they have completed 60 credit hours, though many aim to choose a major before the end of their first year.\n*   **Opportunity to Boost GPA:** For competitive majors, applying as undecided can provide an opportunity to boost one's GPA in general education classes before applying to a selective program. This can make a student's application to their chosen major more competitive.\n\n### Internal Transfer Difficulty for Impacted Majors\n\nInternal transfer into certain \"impacted\" or competitive majors at Kansas State University can be challenging and often involves specific requirements.\n\n*   **Selective Admission:** Several programs at K-State have selective admission, which is based on academic performance and space availability. These include majors within the College of Architecture, Planning and Design, the Carl R. Ice College of Engineering, the College of Business, Interior Design, Psychology, and all health-related professions. For transfer students, these programs often require higher GPAs than the general university admission requirement.\n*   **Specific GPA and Prerequisite Requirements:** Changing majors, especially into a different college, may require fulfilling specific GPA requirements or prerequisite classes. For example, the College of Education requires grades of C or better in admission to teacher education courses, and some health and human sciences programs also have grade requirements for foundational courses.\n*   **Process for Changing Majors:** If a student initially applies to a less competitive major or as undeclared and later decides to pursue a competitive major like Computer Science (in the Carl R. Ice College of Engineering), they would need to follow specific internal transfer procedures. This typically involves discussing the desired change with their current academic advisor and contacting the Dean's Office or Student Services of the college that houses the new major. For instance, to transfer into the College of Engineering, students would email Engineering Student Services, informing them of their current curriculum and the desired new curriculum.\n\n**Example:** If a student initially applies to K-State with a strong interest in Computer Science within the College of Engineering, but is concerned about direct admission, they might consider:\n*   **Applying to Exploratory Studies or a less competitive major:** This allows them to demonstrate academic success in initial coursework.\n*   **Considering a related but less competitive field as a fallback:** While not explicitly stated as an application strategy, an academic advisor could help students identify related majors with potentially less stringent entry requirements. For instance, if Computer Science is highly competitive, a student might initially pursue a major like Cognitive Science (often found in the College of Arts & Sciences) while completing foundational math and science courses that would also apply to a Computer Science degree. This would allow them to build a strong K-State GPA before attempting an internal transfer into the Computer Science program. The internal transfer process for competitive majors often entails meeting specific GPA benchmarks and prerequisite coursework to be considered for admission into the desired program."
