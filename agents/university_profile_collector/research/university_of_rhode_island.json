    "alternate_major_strategy": "When applying to the University of Rhode Island (URI), strategic consideration of alternate majors can be beneficial, particularly for highly competitive programs. URI also has a structured process for changing majors after admission, though transferring into certain impacted fields remains competitive.\n\n### Alternate Major Strategy During Admission\n\nFor applicants to highly competitive programs such as Engineering, Nursing, and the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program, URI's admission process allows for flexibility. If an applicant is not admissible to their first-choice competitive major, they may still have the opportunity to be considered for admission to another major on a space-available basis. This suggests that indicating a backup major, or being open to an alternative, can increase an applicant's chances of admission to the university, even if not to their initial top-choice program.\n\n### Changing Major After Admission (Internal Transfer)\n\nThe University of Rhode Island has a \"streamlined\" process for students looking to change their major after admission. Statistics show that approximately 50% of first and second-year students at URI change their majors, often between the fall and spring semesters.\n\nThe general process for changing majors involves several steps:\n1.  **Log in to Starfish:** Students use their URI single sign-on credentials to access the Starfish system.\n2.  **Find an Advisor:** Through Starfish, students can locate an advisor for their desired new major. If unsure, they can use the \"Discuss Change of Major/Minor\" service.\n3.  **Schedule and Attend an Appointment:** Students schedule a meeting with the advisor for the new major, noting their interest in switching majors in the comment box.\n4.  **Complete Change of Major Form:** During the meeting, the advisor will guide the student through the next steps, including filling out the necessary change of major form.\n\nFor first and second-year students, the University College for Academic Success (UCAS) plays a key role in guiding them through this process. It is important for students to discuss how a major change might affect their financial aid, scholarships, and projected graduation year.\n\n### Internal Transfer Difficulty for Impacted Majors\n\nWhile the process for changing majors is generally accessible, transferring into certain \"impacted\" or highly competitive majors, such as Nursing, can be challenging. Admission to these programs is not guaranteed, even for students already admitted to URI with a different major, due to limited capacity and competitive selection processes. Many students who switch majors do so due to academic struggles, particularly in courses heavy in science, technology, and math, such as those found in engineering and nursing programs. This highlights that while a change of major is possible, strong academic performance is often crucial for successful internal transfer into demanding fields."

Crucially, connect your interests to *specific* aspects of URI's programs, faculty, projects, or campus culture, rather than listing general statistics or prestige. Mentioning a visit or a particular connection you've had with an aspect of the school can make your essay stand out.",
      "Show, Don't Just Tell, Your Experiences and Resilience: Instead of making vague statements (e.g., \"I want to help people\"), use concrete examples and narratives to demonstrate your commitment, growth, and how you've overcome challenges. For instance, in the Talent Development essay, highlight aspects of your lived experience that make you an ideal candidate and show how you've demonstrated resilience.",
      "Avoid Common Cliches and Generic Statements: Steer clear of overused topics like \"loving to learn\" or focusing solely on job stability/salary. For majors, don't emphasize the prestige of the profession; instead, demonstrate a genuine passion. In general, avoid overly political, religious, or dramatic statements, and don't make excuses for academic shortcomings.",
      "Connect Your Past Experiences to Future Goals at URI: Clearly explain how your academic, personal, and professional experiences have led you to this point and how the specific URI program will help you achieve your aspirations.
