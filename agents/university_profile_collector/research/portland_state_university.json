      "Be Aware of Selective Admission Majors: While PSU generally has a high acceptance rate (around 91%), certain majors have selective admission requirements that go beyond the general university admission. These often include programs within the Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science, Special Education, Social Work, Architecture, and Graphic Design. For these, a separate departmental application, portfolio review, or specific lower-division coursework might be necessary before enrolling in upper-division classes.",
      "Explore Early and Utilize Resources, Especially for STEM/Competitive Fields: If you are considering majors in engineering, computer science, other sciences, health, business, or the arts, it is advisable to explore these courses early. Taking introductory courses in areas of interest is a recommended way to explore potential majors. Advisors are available to assist with self-assessment, understanding major options, and aligning your interests with available programs.",
      "Understand Declaration Timelines: You are generally required to declare a major by the time you reach 90 credits. If you are a transfer student with 90 or more credits, you must declare your major within your first term at PSU. While you can still change your major after this point, the exploratory option within Pathways becomes unavailable."

    "college_ranking_tactics": [
      "Assess program-specific rankings and reputation: While overall university rankings exist, it's crucial to look into the rankings and reputation of specific programs or colleges within PSU that align with your interests. For example, Portland State's College of Urban and Public Affairs consistently receives national recognition, and its Business School (AACSB accredited) and various graduate programs also have specific rankings.",
      "Evaluate post-graduation outcomes and career opportunities: Consider the success rates of graduates from specific colleges or programs, including employment rates and salary levels. This can indicate the strength of the program in preparing students for their chosen careers.",
      "Examine faculty resources and student-to-faculty ratio: A lower student-to-faculty ratio can suggest more personalized attention and interaction with professors. It's also worth looking into the proportion of full-time faculty versus adjuncts, and faculty compensation, as these can impact the quality of instruction.",
      "Consider student support services and retention/graduation rates: High freshmen retention rates and four-year (or six-year) graduation rates can indicate student satisfaction and the effectiveness of university and college-level support systems. PSU is noted for its service-learning emphasis and commitment to student success.",
      "Investigate real-world application and community engagement opportunities: Given PSU's strong emphasis on community engagement and its urban location, consider how different colleges and programs integrate practical, real-world experience, internships, and community-based learning into their curricula. This can be a significant factor for hands-on learners."

    "alternate_major_strategy": "Portland State University's 'Pathways' program allows undeclared or exploring students to group similar majors, providing advisement to align interests with available programs. Students are generally required to declare a major by 90 credits, but can change it later, though the exploratory Pathway option becomes unavailable.",
    "essay_tips": [
      "Tailor your statement to Portland State University specifically. Research the programs, faculty, and opportunities that interest you at PSU and explain how these align with your goals to demonstrate genuine interest and that you've done your homework.",
      "Be authentic and tell a unique story. Your personal statement should reflect your genuine self, capturing your journey, motivations, and future goals through a compelling narrative, rather than just listing accomplishments. Sharing a specific anecdote or experience that has significantly impacted you can help showcase your character and individuality.",
      "Show growth and self-awareness. Admissions officers look for your ability to learn, grow, and adapt. In your essay, demonstrate how experiences have changed you and what insights you've gained that will be valuable for your time at PSU.",
      "Understand and directly address the prompt. Make sure you are addressing the prompt and answering the question directly, focusing on the main question rather than getting sidetracked by peripheral topics.",
      "Focus on quality, conciseness, and strong organization. Craft clear, concise, and engaging prose. While PSU may not provide a strict word limit for general personal statements, generally aim for 500-650 words. For Honors College essays, the suggested length is typically 300-500 words. Ensure your essay has a clear beginning, middle and end, with a strong introduction to grab the reader's attention."
