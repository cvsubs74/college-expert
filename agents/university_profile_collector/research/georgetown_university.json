It emphasizes a holistic admissions process and offers extensive research opportunities across various disciplines.",

      "social_environment": "Georgetown offers a vibrant social environment with over 250 student clubs and organizations, ranging from performing arts to volunteering and debate. While there are parties and a 'work hard, play hard' mentality, the social scene is less dominated by large Greek life parties compared to some state schools, focusing more on student-led events and exploring the diverse offerings of D.C.",
      "transportation_impact": "The absence of a direct Metrorail stop in Georgetown means students largely rely on the University's GUTS bus system, which connects to Metro stations, or other public transit. This can make off-campus travel challenging, particularly on weekends when GUTS bus availability may be limited. The historic nature of the Georgetown neighborhood also presents accessibility barriers for students with mobility impairments. Efforts are being made towards sustainable transportation and a pedestrian-friendly campus.",
      "research_impact": "As an R1: Doctoral University with very high research activity, Georgetown offers extensive research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. These include programs like GUROP (Georgetown University Research Opportunities Program), Kalorama Fellowships, and the Lisa J. Raines Summer Research Fellowship. The university actively fosters industry collaborations and partnerships, with research priorities in areas such as religion, ethics, science, public policy, and cancer medicine."
