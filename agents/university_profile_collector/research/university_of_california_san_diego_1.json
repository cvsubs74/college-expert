The campus offers a diverse range of over 570 clubs and organizations, including cultural groups, fraternities, and sororities, which represent about 20% of the student population. Major events like the Sun God Festival contribute to a dynamic atmosphere. While it has sometimes been labeled 'socially dead,' the university actively provides numerous social opportunities, and students can find a rich social life by proactively engaging with campus activities and communities.",

The presence of free on- and off-campus shuttles (Triton Transit) and a free sticker for selected MTS public bus routes provides convenient travel options within San Diego. The recently extended MTS Blue Line trolley directly connects downtown San Diego to the campus, making commuting and exploring the city easier for students without personal vehicles. This extensive network reduces reliance on cars, supports environmental friendliness, and integrates campus life more closely with the broader San Diego community.",
      "research_impact": "Research is a cornerstone of UC San Diego's identity, profoundly impacting campus life by creating a robust academic and experiential learning environment. As a 'student-centered, research-focused' institution, it offers extensive research opportunities for undergraduates across various disciplines through programs like the Research Experience and Applied Learning (REAL) Portal, the Undergraduate Research Hub, and specialized programs in engineering, biomedical sciences, and oceanography. These opportunities allow students to become deeply immersed in projects with real-world applications, fostering critical skills, enhancing career competitiveness, and establishing strong ties with faculty and industry mentors."
