A recommendation form from an academic reference is optional for these applicants. Admitted students may need to complete placement testing. International applicants who are non-native English speakers must submit an acceptable score on the IELTS, TOEFL, MET, or Duolingo test. Wayne State University also employs a \"Highest Section\" SAT Score Choice policy, also known as superscoring, and considers the SAT Essay/ACT Writing section optional.",

If you are not firmly decided on a highly competitive major, applying to a less competitive program might improve your chances of admission to the university.",
      "Explore \"undeclared\" or \"exploratory\" options: If you are unsure about your major, Wayne State offers exploratory programs, particularly in the freshman year, which can expose you to various courses in a specific area. These courses often count towards general education requirements and do not necessarily delay graduation. The University Advising Center can provide guidance on these exploratory tracks. This can be a strategic way to gain admission to the university while giving you time to discover your academic interests and choose a major once enrolled.",
      "Leverage automatic admission to certain schools: For instance, students who declare a business major on their Wayne State application and are accepted to the university are automatically admitted to the Mike Ilitch School of Business. This can be a strategic approach if you are interested in business and meet the general university admission requirements.",
      "Research major-specific requirements and speak with advisors: Before applying, it is beneficial to explore your options and speak with academic advisors or admissions counselors about your specific interests to understand how they align with Wayne State's programs. Some specific programs, especially at the graduate level, may have additional application processes, essays, and GPA requirements. Understanding these nuances for your desired major can inform your application strategy."

These programs, advised by the Exploratory and Transitional Student Center (ETSC), allow students to delve into various fields of study during their first year while simultaneously fulfilling general education requirements, without delaying their time to graduation. If a student has a strong interest in a competitive major but is concerned about direct admission, applying to an \"exploratory track\" could provide an entry point to the university, allowing them to strengthen their academic record at Wayne State before attempting to declare a more competitive major. For the Mike Ilitch School of Business, students are automatically admitted to the school if they declare a business major on their initial application and are accepted into the university.
