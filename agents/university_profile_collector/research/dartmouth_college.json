    "executive_summary": "Dartmouth College is a prestigious Ivy League institution known for its strong undergraduate focus, vibrant Greek culture, and a unique year-round quarter system. Located in the rural Upper Valley region of New Hampshire, it offers a highly selective academic environment.",
    "market_position": "Elite Private",
    "admissions_philosophy": "Dartmouth College employs a highly selective admissions process, characterized by a holistic review, and is need-blind for all applicants, including international students. The college commits to meeting 100% of demonstrated financial need. In 2024, Dartmouth announced it would once again require applicants to submit test scores.",

      {
        "category": "Selectivity",
        "insight": "Dartmouth's admissions are extremely competitive, with an acceptance rate of 5.3% for the Class of 2028 and 6.03% for the Class of 2029.",
        "implication": "Prospective students need an exceptionally strong academic profile, including high SAT/ACT scores (typically 1510-1560 SAT or 33-35 ACT), and compelling extracurriculars."

    ],
    "campus_dynamics": {
      "social_environment": "Dartmouth is known for a 'work hard, play hard' culture, with social life heavily influenced by its strong Greek system. While Greek life dominates, parties are often open to non-members, fostering a friendly campus atmosphere. The Dartmouth Outing Club (DOC) is a prominent organization, offering extensive year-round outdoor activities and serving as the nation's oldest and largest collegiate outing club. The small student body encourages a close-knit community where social activities often revolve around the campus.",
      "transportation_impact": "Despite its rural New England setting in Hanover, New Hampshire, Dartmouth College provides robust transportation options. The Dartmouth Coach offers essential connections to major cities like Boston (including Logan Airport) and New York City. On-campus, free shuttle services, such as the Campus Connector and Advanced Transit, along with readily available Zipcars, ensure students can easily navigate Hanover and access surrounding Upper Valley towns for essentials and recreation. This comprehensive system minimizes the isolation often associated with rural campuses.",
      "research_impact": "Dartmouth is recognized for 'very high research activity' and provides extensive undergraduate research opportunities across various disciplines. Strong emphasis is placed on sciences, with significant programs available through the Geisel School of Medicine, Thayer School of Engineering, and Computer Science department. The college offers numerous scholarships and programs, such as the Academic Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (ASURE), Sophomore and Junior Research Scholars, and the James O. Freedman Presidential Scholars Program, to support student research. Faculty are actively engaged in mentoring undergraduates, providing a rich environment for intellectual and academic development."
