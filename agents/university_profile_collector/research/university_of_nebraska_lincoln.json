This involves improving graduate and retention rates, offering expanded scholarship opportunities (like the Peter Kiewit Foundation Engineering Academy), increasing faculty hires, and providing robust student support services such as academic advising, career coaching, and free tutoring. The university's N2025 Strategic Plan and Quality Initiative also aim to improve persistence, degree completion, and career development for all students, including those historically underserved.",

Investing in competitive faculty compensation also helps attract top talent.",

It is recommended to research different majors using the undergraduate catalog, review 4-year plans, and engage in self-reflection regarding personal skills, interests, and values. Meeting with academic or career advisors in either the specific college or the Explore Center is also encouraged. Some 'pre-professional' tracks, like pre-law, are advising categories and not majors themselves, offering flexibility to combine with any undergraduate major.",

Students must consult their current advisor and the change is processed through the Office of the University Registrar. This typically requires obtaining a College-Major-Degree-Advisor Change Form, securing signed approval from the current college, and then obtaining signed approval from the new college (if changing colleges) along with the new advisor's name. For internal transfers into specific colleges, academic requirements apply. For example, to declare a major in the College of Business from another UNL college, students need a 2.5 GPA and must complete a 'Transfer In Session.' Similarly, to declare a major within the College of Engineering, current students must have a 2.5 cumulative GPA and be 'calc ready' (Math 106). These specific GPA and course readiness requirements for entering certain colleges suggest a competitive or structured internal transfer process for impacted or in-demand majors."

Students, a mix of those from small-town Nebraska, Lincoln, Omaha, and out-of-state and international backgrounds, are generally described as kind and friendly, reflecting Midwestern manners. There are numerous opportunities for involvement with over 500 registered student organizations. While students appreciate the vibrant campus life and diverse opportunities, some note that making connections can be challenging without engaging in Greek life. The Lincoln community is also seen as positive and outgoing, especially around sporting events like Division I football.",
      "transportation_impact": "The University of Nebraska-Lincoln's three distinct campuses (City, East, and Innovation) are close in proximity, allowing students to travel between them via bus, bike, or on foot. All UNL students receive a complementary bus pass for unlimited rides on StarTran Lincoln Bus Service, which covers both campus and city routes. Lincoln is also described as a very bike-friendly city and campus, featuring over 183 miles of trails and a bike-share program, BikeLNK. For students with classes across different campuses, it is recommended to plan schedules with distances in mind due to only 10 minutes between class periods. Parking issues are a common complaint among students.",
      "research_impact": "The University of Nebraska-Lincoln offers strong undergraduate research opportunities through programs like the Nebraska Summer Research Program (SRP), Undergraduate Creative Activities and Research Experiences (UCARE), and First Year Research Experience (FYRE). These programs provide paid opportunities for students to work with faculty mentors on cutting-edge research across various fields, including agriculture, engineering, humanities, and sciences. Many of these research experiences are nationally funded by organizations such as the NSF, USDA, or NIFA, and offer a preview of graduate school life along with professional development workshops. The university also has robust industry ties facilitated by the Office of Research and Innovation, NUtech Ventures, Nebraska Innovation Campus, and Industry Relations. These entities work to advance public-private partnerships, commercialize technologies, and foster research collaborations with the private sector, contributing to economic development."
