      "When applying to Clarkson University, a moderately selective institution with an acceptance rate of approximately 77-78%, strategic major selection involves demonstrating a strong fit and readiness for your chosen field within their holistic review process. While specific \"easier majors to get into\" are not detailed in available admissions information, applicants can enhance their chances by focusing on these strategies:\n\n*   **Align your high school curriculum and performance with your intended major.** Clarkson places significant emphasis on a high GPA (the average for admitted students is 3.82) and completion of challenging coursework, such as honors or Advanced Placement (AP) classes. For majors in prominent fields like engineering or other STEM areas at Clarkson, excelling in advanced math and science courses is particularly crucial to demonstrate preparedness and commitment to your chosen discipline.\n*   **Articulate a clear and compelling reason for your chosen major in your application essays and secure strong letters of recommendation.** Clarkson employs a holistic admissions approach, considering factors beyond just grades and test scores, including extracurricular activities, leadership, and personal achievements. A well-crafted personal statement that conveys genuine interest and how your experiences have shaped your desire to pursue a specific major at Clarkson, coupled with recommendations that speak to your aptitude in that field, can significantly strengthen your application.\n*   **If your intended major is in a popular or potentially competitive field (e.g., certain engineering disciplines), aim for academic metrics at the higher end of Clarkson's admitted student profile.** While major-specific acceptance rates are not publicly disclosed, engineering programs are a significant part of Clarkson's offerings, with Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Electrical Engineering granting a substantial number of bachelor's degrees. To stand out for such programs, it is strategic to present an overall application that is at the stronger end of Clarkson's admitted student statistics, including SAT scores between 1200-1390 or ACT scores between 26-31 (if submitting)."

    "alternate_major_strategy": "alternate_major_strategy: While specific 'alternate major' application guidance for Clarkson University is not explicitly detailed in the search results, general advice for competitive majors (like Computer Science in Engineering) at other universities suggests listing a backup major in a different college if the primary choice is highly competitive. This approach aims to increase the chances of university admission, with the understanding that internal transfers may be possible later. Clarkson does offer an Individually Designed Program (Bachelor of Professional Studies) which provides flexibility and interdisciplinary study, allowing students to design a curriculum tailored to their objectives.; internal_transfer_difficulty: Changing majors at Clarkson University, particularly before starting or as an underclassman, appears to be a relatively painless process, as many foundational courses are shared across majors. The university's administration is generally supportive of students transferring to a major where they are more likely to succeed academically and professionally. For graduate students, there is a formal 'Program Change Request Form' for changing majors, which suggests a structured, though not necessarily difficult, process for undergraduates as well. The Class Scheduling and Advanced Standing Questionnaire for accepted undergraduates also considers the intended major for initial schedule creation."
