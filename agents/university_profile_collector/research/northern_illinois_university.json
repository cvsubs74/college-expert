      "Consider Starting as Undeclared for Flexibility and Exploration: Northern Illinois University actively supports students who are undecided about their major. It's noted as \"one of our most popular majors as freshmen\". The Academic Advising Center is specifically designed to assist undeclared students in exploring their strengths, interests, and potential career paths, helping them choose a major by taking general education courses in their first year. This approach allows students to gain college experience before committing to a specific program, potentially avoiding the need to change majors multiple times.",
      "Research Major-Specific Admission and Retention Requirements: While NIU has a general acceptance rate of around 70%, admission to the university does not guarantee entry into all specific majors. Some programs have \"Limited Admissions and Limited Retention Requirements,\" meaning they may have additional criteria beyond general university admission, such as higher GPA prerequisites or specific course completions. For example, Nursing and certain Computer Science emphases have specific GPA requirements for admission into the major and may be competitive. Therefore, it's crucial to investigate the specific admission and retention criteria for any major of interest before applying.",
      "Explore Majors Beyond Highly Competitive Fields if Not Set on a Specific Path: Popular and well-regarded programs at NIU include Business (especially Accountancy and Marketing), Health Professions (like Nursing and Physical Therapy), and Engineering (Mechanical, Electrical, Industrial and Systems). If a student's academic profile is not as strong for these competitive fields, or if they are exploring options, researching other majors without limited admissions could be a strategic approach to ensure acceptance into a desired program. While not explicitly listed as \"easier,\" majors without specific higher GPA prerequisites or competitive entry processes would logically have a less stringent major-specific admission.",
      "Leverage Academic Advising to Understand Program Suitability: NIU emphasizes academic advising, with specific offices within each college and the central Academic Advising Center available to guide students. Utilizing these resources early can help students understand the curriculum, prerequisites, and career outcomes for various majors. This proactive engagement can help in making an informed and strategic decision, especially for those considering fields with specific requirements or those who are undecided."

    "college_ranking_tactics": [

      "Consider student outcomes, including graduation rates and career opportunities: Investigate statistics like student retention and graduation rates, which are factors in national rankings, and explore the employability and opportunities for graduates from specific programs.",
      "Examine the campus living and social environment: Evaluate the quality of residence halls and the overall campus community, as these can significantly impact a student's comfort and sense of belonging.",

    ],
    "alternate_major_strategy": "### Alternate Major Strategy\n\nFor prospective students, especially those eyeing highly competitive programs, an alternate major strategy at NIU can involve several approaches:\n\n*   **Declare an \"Undecided\" Major:** NIU embraces undecided students and provides a dedicated Academic Advising Center to help them explore various programs and align their interests with a suitable major. Many students change their majors during their undergraduate studies, with 75-80% of undergraduates making such a change. Students are generally required to declare a major by the completion of 60 credit hours, though exceptions can be made. This approach allows students to start at NIU, complete general education requirements, and then decide on a major with the support of advisors.\n*   **Choose a Related, Less Competitive Major:** If a student's first-choice major is known to be highly selective, they might consider applying to a related but less competitive major within a different college. This allows them to gain admission to the university and potentially take foundational courses that could apply to their preferred major later. For example, if Computer Science in the College of Engineering is highly competitive, a student might consider a major in a related field that is not limited. While no specific example like \"CS to Cognitive Science\" was found for NIU in the search results, the general principle applies due to limited admissions in some programs.\n*   **Utilize Transfer Guides:** For students considering transferring, NIU provides \"major guides\" which outline recommended courses to take prior to transfer for specific majors, along with their admission requirements. This resource can be valuable for planning an alternate major pathway if their initial choice proves too difficult to enter directly.\n\n### Internal Transfer Difficulty\n\nThe difficulty of internally transferring to a different major at Northern Illinois University varies, particularly for impacted or limited-admission programs:\n\n*   **Competitive for Impacted Majors:** Admission to NIU does not guarantee acceptance into a specific major, as some programs have limited admissions and additional requirements. For instance:\n    *   **Computer Science:** Students enrolled at NIU are eligible to apply for admission to the major after completing specific requirements, including maintaining at least a 2.00 GPA in computer science courses.\n    *   **Medical Laboratory Sciences (MLS):** Admission is competitive, based primarily on GPA in prerequisite courses, overall GPA, letters of recommendation, and a personal goal statement.\n    *   **Nursing:** Current NIU students must meet specific prerequisite course completions (e.g., BIOS 103/105, BIOS 357, CHEM 110/1110, ENG 203, STAT 100) and submit a separate nursing application by the deadline to be considered for admission to the program.\n*   **Graduate Level Major Changes:** Admitted graduate students can use a \"Change of Degree Level/Specialization\" form. However, if a graduate student wishes to add a program offered in a department other than the one they are currently admitted to, they might be required to submit a new application. Not all departments allow changes or additions of majors/specializations without a new application.\n\nIn summary, while NIU offers support for students exploring majors and changing their academic paths, prospective and current students should be aware of specific admission requirements and the competitive nature of certain programs when planning their major strategies.",
