For many programs, ECU has a high overall acceptance rate (90%), suggesting that a strong academic record generally leads to admission. Focusing on a major you genuinely enjoy and can excel in can lead to better academic performance and a more fulfilling college experience, which is crucial regardless of the major's competitiveness.",
      "Be Aware of \"Competitive and Selective\" Majors and Their GPA Requirements: While ECU has a high overall acceptance rate, some specific majors are designated as \"competitive and selective\" and have higher GPA requirements for admission into the program. These include, but are not limited to, Athletic Training (2.75*), Child Life (3.0*), some Engineering programs (2.8*), Interior Design (2.5*), Public Health Studies (Pre-health Professions concentration - 2.75*), Recreational Therapy (2.5*), and Social Work (2.5*). If you are aiming for one of these programs, ensure your academic profile meets or exceeds their specific criteria.",
      "Utilize ECU's Major Exploration Resources: East Carolina University provides several tools to help students explore majors and career paths. The \"Degree Explorer\" allows you to search for majors based on interests, career opportunities, and course offerings. Additionally, the \"Major Exploration Guide\" and \"What Can I Do with this Major?\" resources from Career Services can help you understand potential career areas and employers associated with different fields of study. Engaging with these resources can help you make an informed decision and confirm if a chosen major aligns with your long-term goals.",
      "Consider \"Undecided\" or a Broad Major to Start, but Plan to Declare Promptly: It is normal for students to begin college as \"undecided.\" ECU provides academic advising and resources for undecided students. However, it is recommended not to delay declaring a major for too long, as waiting past your freshman year could potentially extend your time to graduation due to course sequencing. If you're unsure, starting with a broader major, like those within the Thomas Harriot College of Arts and Sciences, can allow flexibility while fulfilling general education requirements.",
      "For Pre-Professional Tracks, Focus on Prerequisites and GPA, Not Just the Major Title: For students aspiring to professional schools (e.g., medicine, law, dentistry, physical therapy), the undergraduate major itself is often less critical than completing specific prerequisite courses, maintaining a high overall GPA, achieving strong standardized test scores, and gaining relevant experiences. ECU's academic advising explicitly states that professional schools do not typically care about the undergraduate major as long as prerequisites are met and strong performance is demonstrated. This allows you to choose an undergraduate major you are passionate about while still fulfilling the requirements for your desired professional program."

Understand how effectively each program prepares students for their desired career paths or further graduate studies.",

If applicable, consider the quality of housing options and how the living environment contributes to the overall college experience.",

Only coursework where a student has earned a 'C-' (1.7) or higher will transfer. For a course to be a direct equivalent, credit hours must match, otherwise, they may transfer as electives. While there is no limit to the amount of transferable credit ECU can award, students must complete a minimum of 25% of the degree credit hours and 50% of the total hours required in the major at ECU. A minimum of 50% of the semester hours required in the student's major must be earned through enrollment in an institutionally accredited senior college. For admission, transfer students with 24 or more transferable semester hours need a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5. Students taking courses concurrently at ECU and another institution must not exceed ECU's credit hour limits (18 sh for fall/spring, 7 sh for 5-week summer, 14 sh for 11-week summer)."
