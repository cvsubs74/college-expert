Some programs at UNH are designated as 'competitive majors,' including health sciences, kinesiology, occupational therapy, nursing, and certain majors within the Paul College of Business and Economics. These may have limited capacity or specific prerequisites. Applying to a less competitive major, if you're not fully set on a highly competitive field, might increase your chances of admission to the university, with the possibility to explore other interests later.",
      "Apply as undeclared to explore options. A significant portion of first-year students (around 28%) enter UNH as undeclared. Students have until the second semester of their sophomore year to officially declare a major, providing ample time to take various courses and explore different fields before committing. UNH offers resources like academic advisors and a dedicated seminar (COLA 401) to assist undeclared students in finding their path.",
      "If you have a general interest area, consider being undeclared within a specific college. For instance, if you are interested in health-related fields but unsure of a specific major, you can apply undeclared within the College of Health and Human Services. This allows you to explore the majors and career pathways available within that broader area with tailored advising and programs.",

It's crucial to investigate if your desired major has additional application requirements, such as portfolios or auditions, and to prepare accordingly.",

The university encourages this thoughtful approach, offering resources like the COLA 401 class, which helps students explore major, career, and internship options, and regular meetings with academic advisors to build an academic plan. This can be a strategic backup, allowing you to fulfill general education requirements while preparing for an internal transfer to your preferred major.\", 'Contact Admissions for guidance: If you know you want to change your major even before the fall semester begins, you can contact the UNH Admissions Office to discuss your options.']; internal_transfer_difficulty_for_competitive_majors: {'competitive_enrollment_restrictions': 'Some majors have competitive enrollment restrictions for incoming first-year students.', 'prerequisites_and_gpa': 'To internally transfer into a competitive major, students typically need to fulfill specific coursework and achieve a particular cumulative GPA. For example: Health Sciences (BS): Requires successful completion of Biomedical Science (BMS) 507 and 508, a cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher, and a letter of interest. Applications are accepted during the spring semester with an April 15th deadline. Nursing: A cumulative GPA of 3.2 or higher is strongly recommended, along with the completion or current enrollment in Biomedical Science 507, Biomedical Science 508, Psychology 401, and English 401. The application also requires grade reports and an essay, and an interview may be necessary. Other CHHS majors like Communication Sciences & Disorders, Exercise Science, and Health Management & Policy also have specific GPA and course requirements for transfer.', 'limited_space': 'Admission to these competitive programs as an internal transfer is competitive and can be very limited. Students interested in competitive BS degree programs, such as those in Health Sciences, should consult with the appropriate Department program coordinator for specific admissions information.'}"
