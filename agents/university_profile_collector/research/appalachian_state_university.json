For students not completing an AA or AS degree, up to 30 semester hours of Universal General Education Transfer Component (UGETC) coursework from a North Carolina Community College may apply to lower-division general education requirements.\n*   **Grade Requirements**: Only courses with a grade of 'C' (2.0) or higher from regionally accredited institutions are eligible for transfer; grades of \"C- (minus)\" and below will not transfer.\n*   **Regional Accreditation**: Transfer credits are only accepted from regionally accredited postsecondary institutions.\n*   **Age of Coursework**: Coursework older than 10 years is subject to review by academic departments to determine transferability and may initially transfer as elective credit unless a petition process is completed.\n*   **Developmental/Remedial Coursework**: Appalachian State University does not accept developmental, remedial, or supplemental coursework for transfer credit.\n*   **Residency Requirements**: A minimum of 25% of the credit hours required for the degree, along with at least 18 semester hours in the major and 9 semester hours in the minor (if applicable), must be completed in residence at Appalachian.\n*   **Prior Approval for Post-Enrollment Coursework**: Once an undergraduate student has enrolled as a degree-seeking student, prior approval from Appalachian State University is required to take courses at another institution for transfer credit. Failure to obtain such approval may result in the coursework being deemed unacceptable.\n*   **Credit by Exam**: Credits from Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), CLEP, and Cambridge AS & A Levels may be accepted, typically with a minimum score of 3 for AP exams."

For example, if you're interested in a particular major, explain how Appalachian's specific program will help you achieve your educational and career goals.",

Simply listing extracurriculars or achievements without providing specific details, the impact you made, or what you learned from the experience can be a red flag. It's important to showcase your achievements properly and explain their significance.",
      "Typos and grammatical errors. Poor proofreading and editing of essays and other written materials can convey a lack of attention to detail or care for the application. Admissions counselors emphasize the importance of thoroughly reviewing all parts of your application for errors.",
      "Significant decline in senior year grades. While minor grade fluctuations might not be an immediate cause for rescinded admission, a failure to pass courses needed to meet minimum university requirements could lead to an offer being revoked.",
      "Poorly written or generic letters of recommendation (if submitted). While Appalachian State states that recommendations are neither required nor recommended for undergraduate admissions, for other colleges or if a student chooses to submit them, generic or vague letters from teachers who don't know the applicant well can be detrimental. Strong letters take time and should come from individuals who can speak specifically to your qualities and accomplishments."
