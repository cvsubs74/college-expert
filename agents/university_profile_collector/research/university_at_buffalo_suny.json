There are multiple residence halls and campus apartment communities, placing students at the heart of university life. The campus community is diverse and welcoming, with students from all 50 states and over 100 countries. While some students enjoy a lively party scene, others note the campus as conducive to studying.",
      "transportation_impact": "UB operates a free and efficient inter- and intra-campus transportation system with buses (Stampede) and shuttles connecting its three campuses (North, South, and Downtown). This facilitates easy movement between academic buildings, residence halls, and off-campus locations. For off-campus travel and local retailers, the UB Stampede and public transportation (NFTA buses and a Metro station on South Campus) are available. Parking permits are available for students with cars, and park-and-ride lots are an option to alleviate busy academic building parking. Biking is also encouraged with racks, free registration, and winter storage. A tunnel system on North Campus provides a warm and dry way to navigate between buildings during colder or rainy weather.",
      "research_impact": "As an R1 classified university, UB emphasizes a very high level of research activity, providing extensive opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students alike. Students can engage in hands-on research from their first year, working alongside faculty on scientific, creative, and societal challenges. Specific programs like the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) and Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) programs offer paid opportunities and real-world lab experience. UB also fosters interdisciplinary research, with initiatives like the new department of AI and Society, and encourages students to present their findings at various conferences."
