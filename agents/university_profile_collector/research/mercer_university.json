Research Mercer's unique programs, professors, clubs, or campus events, and mention specific details you find appealing to demonstrate your genuine interest.",
      "Show, don't tell; reflect on the impact. Instead of simply listing accomplishments or activities, delve deeper into what those experiences meant to you and the impact they had. Use concrete examples and explain your reflections to showcase your critical thinking skills.",
      "Avoid cliches and write in your own genuine voice. Don't try to write what you think colleges want to hear. Be honest, authentic, and let your personality come through in your essay. Generic statements about 'loving to learn' can be less impactful than a unique perspective.",
      "Connect your interests to specific resources at the school. Demonstrate how your academic and personal interests align with what Mercer offers. Mention specific courses, research opportunities, or campus organizations that resonate with your goals and how you envision contributing to the Mercer community."
    ],
    "red_flags_to_avoid": [
      "Submitting a generic essay. Mercer University's admissions counselors advise applicants to \"be honest and creative with your essay\" and not just list extracurricular involvement. They emphasize using the essay to provide deeper insight into who you are or to explain the importance of a particular activity, rather than simply reiterating your resume. A generic essay that could apply to any university would therefore be a red flag.",
      "Failing to meet academic expectations (GPA and test scores). While Mercer takes a holistic approach, strong academic performance is crucial. The average GPA for admitted students ranges from 3.5 to 4.0, with the middle 50% falling between 3.3 and 4.0. Similarly, average SAT scores are around 1140-1360 (combined Evidence-Based Reading and Writing with Math), and the mean ACT score is 30. Significantly falling below these averages without compelling compensating factors could weaken an application.",
      "Neglecting to submit all required application materials or missing deadlines. Mercer's tips explicitly state the importance of submitting all materials and familiarizing oneself with important dates, details, and deadlines. An incomplete application or one submitted past the deadline would likely hinder admission.",
      "Poorly chosen or weak letters of recommendation. While not explicitly stated as a red flag, Mercer considers recommendation letters as part of its holistic review process and recommends them. Seeking recommendations from teachers who know you well and can speak to your intellectual curiosity, leadership skills, and commitment to community service is advised. Therefore, a recommendation from someone who doesn't know you well, or a generic, unenthusiastic letter, could be a disadvantage."
    ],
    "major_selection_tactics": [
      "Consider less competitive majors, especially if not set on highly popular fields. While Mercer University has a moderately selective admissions process overall, certain fields like Nursing, Engineering, Business, and Health Professions are identified as popular. These popular majors can often attract a larger number of qualified applicants, potentially making them more competitive for admission. If a prospective student is not firmly set on one of these highly sought-after programs, exploring less competitive majors could be a strategic approach to admission.",
      "Align your application with your intended major, particularly for competitive programs. Mercer University utilizes a holistic admissions process, which means they consider not only grades and test scores but also extracurricular activities, recommendation letters, and essays. For programs like health professions, business, and engineering, which Mercer is \"especially known for,\" emphasizing specific achievements and interests in those fields within your application can strengthen your candidacy. Demonstrating a deep interest and preparation in your declared major can significantly impact acceptance chances, as admissions officers often look for \"pointy\" students who pursue academic passions in meaningful ways.",
      "Research major-specific details and academic fit. While explicit major-specific admit rates are not readily available, understanding the various programs offered and their general popularity can guide your decision. Mercer offers a wide array of undergraduate degrees, and exploring them to find an academic fit is crucial. Utilize resources like Mercer's Center for Career and Professional Development to connect majors with potential career paths and ensure your chosen field aligns with your goals.",
      "If truly undecided, consider applying undeclared within a broader college. Some universities do not admit by specific major, particularly liberal arts schools. While Mercer has distinct schools and colleges (e.g., Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Business), applying undeclared within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, for example, might be an option if you are exploring various academic interests and don't want to commit to a potentially highly competitive specific major initially. This can allow for flexibility while still gaining admission to the university."

Students should review these requirements for their chosen college to understand the foundational coursework needed for graduation.",
      "Evaluate specific program strengths and popular majors offered by each college. Different schools and colleges within Mercer are recognized for particular areas of study. For example, Mercer is generally renowned for programs in business, education, and engineering. Assessing the popularity and perceived strength of majors within each college can guide decisions based on academic interest.",
      "Consider the student-to-faculty ratio and reported class sizes for a personalized learning environment. Mercer University maintains a student-to-faculty ratio of 13:1, which is on par with the national average. Student feedback frequently highlights the benefits of smaller class sizes and personalized attention from professors across the university, contributing to a supportive learning environment. While not broken down by individual college, this characteristic generally applies and can be a factor when choosing a college based on the desired level of interaction and support."

    "alternate_major": {
      "alternate_major_strategy": "While Mercer University's application process does not explicitly detail a strategy for alternate majors, general advice for competitive universities suggests that listing an alternate major outside of a highly competitive program (e.g., a different college) can be beneficial if the first choice is denied. It is recommended that the alternate major genuinely interests the applicant. Once admitted, students can formally change their major through the MyMercer portal, typically after their first year or before earning 65 credit hours. For specific guidance, it is always best to contact Mercer's admissions office directly.",

      "Submitting a generic essay. Mercer University's admissions counselors advise applicants to \"be honest and creative with your essay\" and not just list extracurricular involvement. They emphasize using the essay to provide deeper insight into who you are or to explain the importance of a particular activity, rather than simply reiterating your resume. A generic essay that could apply to any university would therefore be a red flag.",
      "Failing to meet academic expectations (GPA and test scores). While Mercer takes a holistic approach, strong academic performance is crucial. The average GPA for admitted students ranges from 3.5 to 4.0, with the middle 50% falling between 3.3 and 4.0. Similarly, average SAT scores are around 1140-1360 (combined Evidence-Based Reading and Writing with Math), and the mean ACT score is 30. Significantly falling below these averages without compelling compensating factors could weaken an application.",
      "Neglecting to submit all required application materials or missing deadlines. Mercer's tips explicitly state the importance of submitting all materials and familiarizing oneself with important dates, details, and deadlines. An incomplete application or one submitted past the deadline would likely hinder admission.",
      "Poorly chosen or weak letters of recommendation. While not explicitly stated as a red flag, Mercer considers recommendation letters as part of its holistic review process and recommends them. Seeking recommendations from teachers who know you well and can speak to your intellectual curiosity, leadership skills, and commitment to community service is advised. Therefore, a recommendation from someone who doesn't know you well, or a generic, unenthusiastic letter, could be a disadvantage."
