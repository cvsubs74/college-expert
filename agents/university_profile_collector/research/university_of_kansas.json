This secures admission to the university, after which the student can work towards meeting the specific prerequisites and GPA requirements for internal transfer into their desired competitive Professional School.

      "internal_transfer_difficulty": "Internal transfer to competitive 'Professional Schools' at the University of Kansas, such as Business, Journalism, Engineering, Architecture, Education and Human Sciences, Nursing, and Pharmacy, is a selective process. [7, 8, 11, 15] These schools have specific admission and GPA requirements, as well as application deadlines, that students must meet to be accepted. [7, 8, 15] For example, the School of Business requires sophomore standing, completion of specific pre-admission foundation courses (e.g., Financial Accounting, Statistics, Microeconomics), and a cumulative GPA of 2.5+ (overall and professional GPA). [15] If a student is initially admitted to a Professional School but later decides to change majors out of it, they would typically transfer to the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences until they are accepted into a different program. [7] Changing a major within the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences generally involves contacting an academic advisor and submitting an online form, appearing to be a more straightforward process.
