        "implication": "Applicants should focus on presenting a strong holistic application, emphasizing high school GPA, challenging coursework, compelling essays, and strong letters of recommendation, as standardized test scores are de-emphasized. Applying Early Action (deadline November 15) could be beneficial for an earlier decision."

        "implication": "Prospective students, especially those interested in Nursing, Business (Analytics, Marketing, Accounting, Finance), or Engineering, should highlight relevant experiences, projects, and career aspirations in their applications. Emphasize how a collaborative, hands-on learning approach and the Jesuit tradition of ethical leadership align with their academic and personal goals."

The university's culture reflects Seattle's spirit, with many students showing passion for social justice and progressive causes. While some students express a desire for more diversity and a more vibrant campus social scene, the overall atmosphere is characterized by support and friendliness.",
      "transportation_impact": "Seattle University's urban campus in downtown Seattle provides ample opportunities for students to engage with the city. Its central location allows students to readily 'take advantage of all the city has to offer'. Commuter students find the campus amenities helpful, and the accessibility to the city makes exploring new places easy. Although specific transport modes like 'walkable campus' and 'bus access' are not explicitly detailed, the urban setting implies good walkability and public transportation options.",
      "research_impact": "Seattle University offers strong undergraduate research opportunities across various disciplines. The College of Science and Engineering has a thriving summer undergraduate research program, supported by over $1 million in grants, endowments, and gift funds, providing paid research positions and opportunities for students to collaborate with faculty on contemporary problems. The Office of Undergraduate Research facilitates faculty-mentored experiences and hosts the annual Student Research and Creativity Conference (SRCCon). Students can also publish their work in the Seattle University Undergraduate Research Journal (SUURJ). A significant 94% of undergraduate students reportedly participate in on-campus, summer, or industry-sponsored research, preparing them for graduate programs and careers. The university also leverages its location to provide industry partnerships with major companies like Amazon and Microsoft for internships and professional experiences."

For instance, if an applicant is highly interested in Computer Science within the College of Science and Engineering, but also has a strong aptitude for a related but less directly competitive field like Cognitive Science (which might fall under Arts & Sciences), they could apply for the competitive major and potentially be considered for an alternate if their qualifications are strong for the university but perhaps not for direct entry into the most competitive program."
