    "executive_summary": "The University of New Mexico is a public flagship research institution classified among R1 universities for very high research activity. It is recognized as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, offering a wide range of academic programs at an affordable price, particularly for in-state residents.",
    "market_position": "Public Flagship Research University",
    "admissions_philosophy": "Undergraduate admission is selective, with an emphasis on academic preparedness, as indicated by GPA and test scores. Some graduate programs, such as Philosophy, employ a more holistic review, considering factors like writing samples, academic record, and letters of recommendation, with GRE scores being optional.",

        "category": "Selectivity",
        "insight": "The University of New Mexico has a relatively high acceptance rate, ranging from 67% to 95% depending on the source, indicating it is not highly selective. Standardized test scores (SAT/ACT) are often optional, and personal essays or letters of recommendation are generally not required for admission.",
        "implication": "Applicants should prioritize meeting the GPA and high school transcript requirements. While not mandatory, submitting strong SAT or ACT scores can be beneficial if they positively reflect academic ability. Focus on ensuring all required documents are accurately submitted."

It offers numerous research opportunities for undergraduates and emphasizes hands-on learning.",
        "implication": "Prospective students, particularly those interested in STEM, health, arts, or business fields, should highlight any past research experiences, relevant projects, or a strong interest in hands-on learning. If an opportunity arises to provide supplemental information or in an interview, showcase specific academic passions related to UNM's strengths."

The campus culture is described as welcoming, progressive, and vibrant, with a wide array of student organizations.",
        "implication": "Applicants who value diversity and inclusivity should emphasize their experiences within diverse communities or their commitment to contributing to such an environment. Students from Hispanic and Native American backgrounds may find UNM to be a particularly supportive and culturally rich academic setting."

      "social_environment": "The University of New Mexico offers a supportive, friendly, and diverse social atmosphere with a welcoming campus culture and numerous extracurricular activities. The campus environment is often described as laid-back or 'chill', without a dominant Greek or strong sports culture. However, some concerns exist regarding safety in the surrounding areas at night.",
      "transportation_impact": "UNM provides a free shuttle system for convenient travel across campus, including to commuter parking lots and key locations like Lobo Village and the Alvarado Transportation Center. Students and some scholars can also access a Free Bus Pass Program for public city buses. While the campus is generally walkable, parking on the main campus can be challenging and expensive. The university is also implementing a 'Safe Mobility Action Plan' to enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and other active transportation methods.",
      "research_impact": "The University of New Mexico offers strong undergraduate research opportunities, considering research a key part of the educational experience. Various on-campus programs, such as the Undergraduate Research, Arts & Design Network (URAD), El Puente Research Fellow Program, and McNair Program, connect students with research. Students engage in diverse research settings, often culminating in presentations, and the university hosts an annual Undergraduate Research Opportunity Conference (UROC). As a public R1 university, UNM has a high level of research activity, with additional opportunities for off-campus research internships."

If you are interested in a specialized or limited-enrollment program, investigate its specific admission requirements and acceptance rates.",

UNM encourages students who are unsure about their major to begin as \"undecided.\" This allows you to take foundational courses and explore different fields of study before committing to a specific program. This can be a strategic approach to discover your interests and strengths, potentially leading you to a major that aligns well with your abilities and the university's offerings.",

While the university's general admission is accessible, individual departments or colleges might have specific coursework, GPA requirements, or application processes for declaring a major or gaining admission into their programs. For example, some programs may look for experience in the field. Always check the requirements for your intended major to ensure you meet all necessary criteria.",

For some students, an alternate path might involve starting at a two-year institution through programs like the Gateway Program before transferring to UNM.",
