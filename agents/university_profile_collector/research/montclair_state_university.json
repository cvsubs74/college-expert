For SAT, the university has a 'Highest Section' policy, also known as superscoring, where the highest section scores across all submitted SAT test dates are considered. The middle 50% SAT scores for admitted students typically range from 970 to 1200, and an ACT score between 17-25 is generally associated with a higher chance of acceptance.",
