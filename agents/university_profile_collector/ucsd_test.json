    "executive_summary": "UC San Diego is a premier public research university located on the Pacific coast, renowned for its STEM prowess, particularly in biology, engineering, and oceanography. The university operates a unique 'Oxford-style' residential college system where undergraduates belong to one of eight distinct colleges, each with its own general education requirements and culture, creating smaller communities within the large research institution. It is consistently ranked among the top public universities globally and is a member of the prestigious Association of American Universities.",
