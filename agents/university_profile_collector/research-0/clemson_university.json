      "social_environment": "Clemson boasts a spirited and inclusive social environment with a strong emphasis on school pride, particularly around athletics, especially football. There are over 550 clubs and organizations, ensuring diverse interests are met. Approximately 25% of students participate in Greek life, which is prominent but not essential for a robust social life. The campus fosters a 'Clemson Family' atmosphere where students feel welcome and supported.",
      "transportation_impact": "On-campus and local transportation is primarily managed by the free Clemson Area Transit (CATbus) system, which serves the campus and surrounding cities like Anderson, Pendleton, Seneca, and Central. Tiger Transit provides on-campus shuttles, including a late-night service, and free holiday airport shuttles to Greenville-Spartanburg (GSP) and Charlotte-Douglas (CLT) International Airports. Parking on campus can be challenging for commuters, often requiring early arrival to secure a spot. The availability of comprehensive free public transit reduces reliance on personal vehicles for daily campus life and local errands.",
      "research_impact": "As a Carnegie R1 research institution, Clemson offers extensive research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. Programs like 'Creative Inquiry' enable undergraduates to engage in faculty-mentored, team-based research projects, often leading to presentations at conferences. The 'Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs)' program, often NSF-funded, provides intensive, hands-on research experiences in STEM fields. Clemson's research aligns with innovation clusters such as Advanced Materials, Cyberinfrastructure and Big Data Science, Energy, Transportation and Advanced Manufacturing, Health Innovation, Human Resilience, and Sustainable Environment, fostering collaboration with industry and contributing to scientific advancements."
