      "social_environment": "UChicago offers a vibrant social environment with over 400 student organizations, residential Houses that foster strong communities, and opportunities for intramural sports, arts, and comedy. While some sources indicate it is not a 'party school' and the Regenstein Library can be a social hub, a thriving Greek system and departmental parties also exist. The social atmosphere in dorms is highly rated. The campus community is described as friendly and supportive, despite the rigorous academics.",
      "transportation_impact": "Located in the Hyde Park neighborhood, UChicago provides extensive transportation options including free UGo shuttles, several CTA bus routes (some free with student ID), Divvy bike-sharing discounts, and a Lyft Ride Smart program for nighttime rides. This comprehensive network effectively connects the campus and the surrounding Hyde Park area, as well as providing access to downtown Chicago, mitigating the impact of its urban location on student mobility.",
      "research_impact": "The University of Chicago is a major research institution, classified with 'very high research activity'. It offers abundant research opportunities for undergraduates across all disciplines, including summer research programs and faculty-mentored projects. The university operates significant research facilities like the Argonne National Laboratory and the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. [cite: 22 (from 2022 data)] This strong research focus enriches the academic experience, provides students with key skills, and prepares them for graduate study and diverse careers."
