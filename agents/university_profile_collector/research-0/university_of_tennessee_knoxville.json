        "social_environment": "Social life is dominated by 'Big Orange' pride, featuring a massive SEC sports culture centered around Neyland Stadium and a vibrant Greek life involving approximately 30% of the student body. The campus atmosphere is described as high-energy with a strong connection to downtown Knoxville.",
        "transportation_impact": "The 910-acre campus is notably hilly and walkable, though students rely heavily on 'The T' (a free on-campus bus system with real-time tracking). Parking is a persistent and significant pain point for students, leading to a recent push for 'Park and Ride' alternative transit solutions.",
        "research_impact": "As an R1 institution, UTK benefits from a unique strategic partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). This collaboration provides undergraduates with elite research internships (like the SMaRT program) and fuels leadership in nuclear science, advanced materials, and supply chain management."
