    "alternate_major_strategy": "At Yale College, your chosen major, or applying as undeclared, generally does not affect admission chances, as admissions officers look holistically at applications. Students are not bound by their declared major on the application and can easily change it, often as late as junior year, by simply updating it in their student portal. Therefore, the strategy isn't about leveraging an alternate major for admission to a 'different college' in the traditional sense, but rather selecting a primary major that genuinely interests you, knowing you have the flexibility to explore and switch. If applying to a demanding field like CS, listing an alternate in a less intensive but related area (e.g., Cognitive Science) can reflect broader academic interests without impacting admissions negatively, as Yale focuses on a liberal arts education where interdisciplinary exploration is encouraged."
