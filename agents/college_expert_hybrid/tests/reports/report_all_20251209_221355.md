### 🏷️ Error Handling

#### ✅ `unknown_university`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

#### ✅ `stanford_not_in_kb`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> Should I apply to Stanford?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent addresses Stanford, provides relevant information about admission chances, and offers helpful guidance on improving the application.

**Agent Response**:

```
Based on your profile, particularly your GPA and intended major of Business, and considering Stanford's extremely low acceptance rate (3.6%) and the high academic profile of admitted students (73.3% had a 4.0 unweighted GPA), admission to Stanford would be very challenging. Your weighted GPA is strong, and your AP scores are good, but your unweighted GPA is below the average for admitted students. Your extracurriculars and awards are good and demonstrate leadership and business interests.

To improve your chances, focus on highlighting your strengths in your application essays, especially the wellness app you created and your research paper. If you haven't already, consider taking the SAT/ACT and aim for a high score to further strengthen your application. Given Stanford's selectivity, it would be a reach school for you. You should also consider applying to other schools that are a better fit for your academic profile.

### ❌ `fit_analysis_flow`

**Description**: User gets fit analysis and follows up with questions  
**Overall Score**: 0.00 | **Status**: FAILED

#### Conversation Flow

**Turn 1** ❌ (Score: 0.00) 🔗

👤 **User**: Analyze my fit for Stanford

🤖 **Agent**:
```
I'm sorry, but I don't have any information about Stanford in my knowledge base. I can try to find similar schools if you'd like.
```

📋 **Judgment**: The agent fails to provide a fit analysis for Stanford and does not use any student profile data. It claims to not have information about Stanford.

**Turn 2** ❌ (Score: 0.00) 🔗

👤 **User**: Why did you categorize it that way?

🤖 **Agent**:
```
I apologize for the confusion. It seems there was a misunderstanding in my previous response. When you asked me to analyze your fit for Stanford, I first tried to look up information about Stanford University in my knowledge base. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find it. My internal tools indicated that "stanford_university" was not a recognized ID in my database. Therefore, my response, "I don't have Stanford in my knowledge base," was based on that specific lookup failure. I then offered to search for similar schools as a helpful next step. The categorization you saw was likely an internal process of how I determine the best tool to use. Since your request involved a specific university and your personal profile, my system attempted to use the `calculate_college_fit` tool, which requires a university ID. When that ID wasn't found, it led to the response you received. I am still under development, and I'm always learning to improve my accuracy and clarity. Thank you for pointing this out!
```

📋 **Judgment**: The response does not explain the reasoning for the fit category, nor does it reference specific factors from the analysis. It explains why it could not find Stanford in its database, but does not address the user's question about the fit category.
