## 📖 Detailed Test Results

### 🏷️ Personalized Analysis

#### ✅ `fit_berkeley`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> Analyze my fit for UC Berkeley

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent successfully analyzed the student's fit for UC Berkeley, providing a fit category, referencing profile information, and offering actionable advice.

**Agent Response**:

```
It looks like UC Berkeley is a REACH school for you, with a match percentage of 50%. This means admission is possible but not guaranteed.

Here's a breakdown of your fit:

**Strengths:**
*   **Course Rigor:** You have taken 5 AP courses with 5 scores of 4+, which is great preparation.
*   **Major Fit:** Your intended major, Business, is offered at Berkeley.

**Areas for Improvement:**
*   **Extracurricular Activities:** This is a significant area. For highly selective schools like Berkeley, demonstrating passion and commitment outside the classroom through extracurriculars is vital. Your profile currently lacks this.
*   **Test Scores:** While many UCs are test-blind, submitting scores could still be a factor in holistic review. Your profile currently has no test scores.
*   **GPA:** Your 3.72 GPA is at the 25th percentile for admitted students.

**Recommendations:**
*   Focus on highlighting any leadership roles or significant contributions within your AP courses or academic projects.
*   Detail any volunteer work or personal projects that showcase your initiative and interests.
*   Consider applying to a range of schools, including more accessible options, to ensure you have strong choices.
*   Submit test scores if you have them, as they are considered.

#### ✅ `fit_ucla`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> What are my chances at UCLA?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent met all criteria by mentioning UCLA, providing a personalized fit assessment based on the user's profile data, and assessing chances of acceptance.

**Agent Response**:

```
UCLA is a highly selective institution, and based on your profile, it falls into the **REACH** category for you. This means that while admission is possible, it's not guaranteed, and your chances are on the lower end.

Here's a breakdown of the factors influencing this assessment:

*   **GPA:** Your weighted GPA is at the 25th percentile for admitted students.
*   **Test Scores:** UCLA is test-blind, meaning they do not consider SAT/ACT scores.
*   **Acceptance Rate:** UCLA has a very low acceptance rate of 9%, making it extremely competitive.
*   **Course Rigor:** You've completed 5 AP courses with strong scores (4s and 5s), which is a positive.
*   **Major Fit:** There's a question about whether "Business" is a directly offered major at UCLA, which could affect your application if you're set on that specific program.
*   **Activities:** Your profile lists some activities and leadership roles, but for a holistic review like UCLA's, more extensive extracurricular involvement is generally preferred.

**Recommendations for strengthening your application:**
*   If Business is not directly offered, research related majors at UCLA and see if your profile aligns with their requirements.
*   Continue to highlight any leadership experiences or unique projects that showcase your initiative and commitment.
*   Craft a compelling narrative in your essays that effectively conveys your strengths and passions, even if your extracurricular list isn't extensive.

#### ✅ `fit_harvard`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> Analyze my fit for Harvard

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent's response successfully mentions Harvard, categorizes it as SUPER_REACH, mentions the low acceptance rate, and provides advice for improving chances.

**Agent Response**:

```
Harvard University is a **SUPER_REACH** for you, with a match percentage of 46%. This is primarily due to its extremely low acceptance rate of 3.6%, which makes admission highly improbable despite a strong application.

Here's a breakdown of the factors:

*   **GPA Match:** Your GPA of 3.72 is slightly below the typical range for admitted students.
*   **Test Scores:** Harvard is test-optional. If you have strong SAT or ACT scores, submitting them could help your application.
*   **Acceptance Rate:** The ultra-selective 3.6% acceptance rate significantly impacts your fit.
*   **Course Rigor:** Your 5 AP courses are a positive factor.
*   **Major Fit:** There's a note that "Business may not be directly offered," suggesting you should verify the availability of business-related programs or consider related majors.
*   **Activities:** The current lack of listed extracurricular activities or awards is a major concern, as Harvard highly values involvement, leadership, and demonstrated passions.
*   **Early Action:** Applying under the Restrictive Early Action (REA) plan offers a slightly higher acceptance rate (8.74%) compared to regular decision.

**Recommendations:**

*   Verify the availability of business programs or explore related majors.
*   Consider applying Restrictive Early Action (REA) to potentially improve your chances.
*   To strengthen your application for highly selective institutions, focus on developing a robust extracurricular profile. Seek leadership opportunities, meaningful internships, or research experiences. If you have strong test scores, consider submitting them.

#### ✅ `fit_nyu_stern`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> What are my chances at NYU Stern?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent correctly identified the university and school, provided a chances assessment, and did not fail due to an invalid university ID.

**Agent Response**:

```
Your chances at NYU's Stern School of Business are considered **REACH**, with a **46% match score**. NYU has a very low acceptance rate of 9.2%, making it a challenging admission.

Here's a breakdown:
*   **GPA:** Your 3.72 GPA is at the 25th percentile for admitted students, which is a good start.
*   **Course Rigor:** You've taken 5 AP courses, demonstrating academic rigor.
*   **Test Scores:** NYU is test-optional. If your SAT/ACT scores are strong, submitting them could help your application.
*   **Extracurriculars/Awards:** This is an area where your application could be strengthened. Highly selective schools like NYU look for leadership, passion, and commitment outside the classroom.
*   **Major Fit:** There's a note that "Stern may not be directly offered" or you might need to specify your major more precisely.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Verify Stern Availability:** Double-check if Stern is a direct admit program or if you need to apply to a specific major within it.
*   **Strengthen Extracurriculars:** Highlight any leadership roles or significant contributions you've made.
*   **Essays:** Ensure your essays powerfully convey your unique story, your interest in NYU, and why Stern is the right place for your academic and personal goals.
*   **Consider Test Scores:** If you have strong standardized test scores, submitting them might be beneficial.

It's recommended to have other "Target" and "Safety" schools in your college list as well.

**Score**: 0.00 | **Status**: FAILED

**User Query**:
> Based on my profile, what are my chances at MIT for EECS?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent acknowledges the question but fails to use profile data or give fit categorization, and does not provide an answer.

#### ✅ `multi_school_chances`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> Analyze my chances at UC Berkeley and USC

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent's response successfully addressed both universities, provided individual fit assessments, and subtly compared them by highlighting similar weaknesses in the profile.

**Agent Response**:

```
Your profile has been analyzed for admission to UC Berkeley and USC. Here's a breakdown of your chances:

**UC Berkeley:**
*   **Fit Category:** REACH
*   **Match Percentage:** 50%
*   **Explanation:** Your GPA and AP course load are strong points. However, UC Berkeley, being highly selective, notes a concern regarding the absence of standardized test scores and, critically, extracurricular activities. Demonstrating commitment and passion outside academics is vital for such institutions.
*   **Recommendations:** Focus on highlighting leadership within academics and any volunteer work or personal projects. If you have strong standardized test scores, consider submitting them.

**University of Southern California (USC):**
*   **Fit Category:** REACH
*   **Match Percentage:** 41%
*   **Explanation:** Your course rigor is a plus, but your GPA is slightly below USC's typical admitted student range. Similar to Berkeley, the lack of standardized test scores and significant extracurricular activities/awards are notable weaknesses. USC highly values well-rounded individuals with demonstrated leadership.
*   **Recommendations:** Emphasize any leadership experiences or unique skills. If you have strong standardized test scores, submitting them would be beneficial. For USC, you should verify if Marketing is a directly offered major or explore related fields.

**Overall Advice:**
To strengthen your applications for both highly competitive universities, it's crucial to present a more well-rounded profile. Detail any leadership roles, significant academic contributions, volunteer work, or personal projects that showcase your initiative and interests. 

It is also strongly recommended to apply to a range of institutions, including those where your chances of admission are higher, to ensure you have solid options for your college education.
