**User Query**:
> Tell me about UCLA's application requirements and deadlines

**Judge Reasoning**:

**Agent Response**:

```
UCLA's application requirements and deadlines are best found on their official Admissions website. You'll want to look for sections specific to undergraduate or transfer admissions, depending on your status.

Generally, you should pay close attention to:

*   **Application Period:** When the application opens and closes for submission.
*   **Personal Insight Questions:** These are UCLA's version of application essays.
*   **Required Documents:** Transcripts and any other necessary materials.
*   **Deadlines:** For submitting your application, any supplementary materials, and the final date to accept an offer of admission.

Since UCLA is test-blind, they do not consider SAT or ACT scores for admissions.

I recommend visiting the official UCLA Undergraduate Admissions website for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
