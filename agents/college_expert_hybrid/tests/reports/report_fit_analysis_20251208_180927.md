## 📖 Detailed Test Results

### 🏷️ Personalized Analysis

#### ✅ `fit_berkeley`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> Analyze my fit for UC Berkeley

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent successfully met all four criteria by mentioning UC Berkeley, providing a fit category, referencing student profile information, and giving actionable advice.

**Agent Response**:

```
UC Berkeley is currently a **SUPER_REACH** for you, with a match percentage of 32%. This is primarily due to its highly competitive 11% acceptance rate and several areas in your profile that need strengthening.

Here's a breakdown of your current standing:

*   **GPA Match:** Your 3.50 GPA is at the 25th percentile for admitted students.
*   **Test Scores:** You have not provided any test scores, which is a significant missing piece of information for a holistic review.
*   **Acceptance Rate:** With an 11% acceptance rate, UC Berkeley is exceptionally selective.
*   **Course Rigor:** Your profile currently shows 0 AP courses, which is a key factor in demonstrating academic challenge.
*   **Major Fit:** No specific major was selected for this analysis, making it harder to assess alignment.
*   **Activities:** While activities have been noted, their impact could be enhanced with more detail or leadership roles.
*   **Early Action:** No specific advantage was identified regarding early action.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Submit Test Scores:** If available, providing SAT or ACT scores could offer additional data points for the admissions committee.
*   **Increase Course Rigor:** Consider enrolling in AP courses or other advanced classes offered at your school to demonstrate academic preparedness.

Given these factors, it's advisable to focus on building a stronger academic profile and consider applying to a broader range of universities that align more closely with your current achievements. UC Berkeley remains a highly aspirational goal that would require significant improvements to your application.

#### ✅ `fit_ucla`

**Score**: 0.67 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> What are my chances at UCLA?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent mentions UCLA and attempts to assess chances but requires further information and therefore does not use pre-existing profile data for personalization.

**Agent Response**:

```
I can help you with that! To give you the most accurate information about your chances at UCLA, I need a little more detail. Please tell me:

*   **What is your current GPA?**
*   **What is your intended major?**
*   **What standardized test scores (SAT/ACT) do you have, if any?**
*   **Are you applying as a freshman or transfer student?**
*   **What is your residency status (in-state or out-of-state)?**

Once I have this information, I can provide a more personalized estimate of your chances at UCLA.

#### ✅ `fit_harvard`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> Analyze my fit for Harvard

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent successfully met all four criteria by mentioning Harvard, categorizing it as a SUPER_REACH, noting its selectivity, and providing advice for improving chances.

**Agent Response**:

```
Harvard University is an ultra-selective institution with an acceptance rate of 3.6%. Given your current profile, which lacks GPA, standardized test scores, AP courses, and extracurricular activities, your application would be considered a SUPER_REACH.

The deterministic scoring reflects this with a low match percentage (30%) and significant points deducted for areas where your profile is not yet competitive. While there are some points for 'Activities' and 'Early Action,' these are insufficient to overcome the absence of core academic and extracurricular components.

To improve your chances for highly selective institutions like Harvard, focus on building a strong academic foundation. This includes taking challenging courses, aiming for the highest possible GPA, and preparing for standardized tests if you choose to submit them. Additionally, engage in meaningful extracurricular activities that showcase your passions, leadership, and commitment. Without these foundational elements, Harvard remains a very difficult aspiration.

Here are some specific recommendations:
*   Focus on a strong upward trend in your remaining semesters.
*   Consider taking additional AP courses.
*   Apply REA (Restrictive Early Action) for a higher acceptance rate.

#### ✅ `fit_nyu_stern`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> What are my chances at NYU Stern?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent correctly identifies the university and school, provides some background information, and doesn't fail due to invalid ID, meeting all criteria.

**Agent Response**:

```
To provide you with an informed assessment of your chances at NYU Stern, I need to access your student profile. Could you please provide me with your email address?

NYU is a highly selective private research university with an overall acceptance rate of 9.2%. The Stern School of Business, specifically, is known to be highly competitive. NYU has a number of undergraduate schools and colleges, including the College of Arts & Science, Tandon School of Engineering, Tisch School of the Arts, and more. They value strong academic records, well-written essays, leadership in extracurricular activities, and standardized test scores (though they remain test-optional through the 2025-2026 application cycle).
