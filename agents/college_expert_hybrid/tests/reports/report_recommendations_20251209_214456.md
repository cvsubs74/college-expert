## 📖 Detailed Test Results

### 🏷️ Strategic Recommendations

#### ✅ `safety_schools`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> Based on my profile, which universities should I consider as safety schools?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent successfully recommends specific safety schools based on the user's profile, providing reasoning for each recommendation.

**Agent Response**:

```
Okay, considering your profile and the universities with business programs in my knowledge base, here's a breakdown of potential safety schools. Remember, "safety" implies a high likelihood of acceptance based on your academic profile being above the average for admitted students. Since I don't have your SAT/ACT scores, this is based primarily on GPA and extracurriculars.

Given your strong GPA (3.72 unweighted, 4.23 weighted) and impressive extracurriculars, I recommend you investigate the following as potential safety schools:

*   **University at Buffalo-SUNY:** Generally has lower admission requirements than some of the other schools listed. Your GPA and activities should make you a strong candidate.
*   **Marquette University:** Known for its business programs and holistic admission approach. Your volunteer work and leadership experience would be viewed favorably.
*   **Illinois Institute of Technology:** While strong in STEM, their business programs may be less competitive. Your application would likely stand out.
*   **University of San Diego:** A good option, but may be a Target school depending on the average stats for admitted business students.

I recommend you research the average GPAs and test scores for admitted business students at each of these universities to confirm they are, in fact, safety schools for you. If you provide your SAT/ACT scores, I can refine this list further.

#### ✅ `improve_for_ucsd`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> What aspects of my profile would strengthen my application to UC San Diego?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent's response mentions UC San Diego, identifies specific areas for improvement like test scores and major-specific activities, and provides actionable advice such as quantifying achievements and focusing essays on leadership skills.

**Agent Response**:

```
Based on your profile, here's what you could focus on to strengthen your application to UC San Diego:

*   **Test Scores:** Your profile doesn't include SAT/ACT scores. Strong scores would significantly improve your application, especially for a competitive school like UC San Diego (acceptance rate 24.8%). Aim for scores in the 700+ range on each section of the SAT or a 30+ on the ACT.
*   **Major-Specific Activities:** While your extracurriculars are impressive, consider highlighting activities that directly relate to your intended major (Business). If possible, participate in business-related competitions, internships, or projects. Even independent projects demonstrating business acumen would be beneficial.
*   **Quantify Achievements:** Whenever possible, quantify your achievements in your activities. For example, instead of saying you "organized fundraisers," state how much money you raised and what the funds were used for.
*   **Essays:** Your essays are a crucial opportunity to showcase your personality, motivations, and how you would contribute to the UC San Diego community. Focus on telling compelling stories that highlight your leadership skills, passion for business, and commitment to inclusivity. Explain how your experiences with special needs students and community outreach have shaped your perspective.
*   **Awards and Recognition:** While you have some awards listed, aim for more significant recognition in business-related activities. Winning a state-level FBLA competition or receiving a prestigious business-related scholarship would make a strong impact.

#### ✅ `balanced_list_business`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> Help me build a balanced college list for Business majors in California

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent successfully created a balanced college list with reach, target, and safety schools, focusing on business programs in California.

**Agent Response**:

```
Okay, I've gathered some basic information from the knowledge base. It seems that for some universities like California State University - East Bay, San Francisco State University and San Jose State University the knowledge base is only returning other universities in California, and not the specific information for the school itself. I will proceed with the schools for which I could gather more information.

Here's the refined list, incorporating acceptance rates:

**Safety Schools:**

*   **San Jose State University:** I couldn't retrieve the acceptance rate.
*   **San Francisco State University:** I couldn't retrieve the acceptance rate.
*   **California State University - East Bay:** I couldn't retrieve the acceptance rate.

**Target Schools:**

*   **University of California - Irvine (UCI):** Acceptance rate 28.94%
*   **University of California - Davis (UCD):** Acceptance rate 41.84%
*   **Loyola Marymount University (LMU):** Acceptance rate 45.1%

**Reach Schools:**

*   **University of California - Berkeley (UCB):** Acceptance rate 11%
*   **University of California - Los Angeles (UCLA):** Acceptance rate 9%
*   **University of Southern California (USC):** Acceptance rate 9.2%

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Standardized Tests:** If you haven't already, take the SAT or ACT and aim for a high score. This will significantly improve your chances, especially at the Reach schools.
2.  **Major Specifics:** Research the specific Business programs at each university. Look at the curriculum, faculty, internship opportunities, and career placement rates.
3.  **Essays:** Craft compelling essays that highlight your passion for business, your leadership skills, and your experiences working with special needs students. Connect your experiences to your future goals in business.
4.  **Extracurricular Focus:** Continue your involvement in FBLA and Children's Rights and You America. Consider taking on additional leadership roles or starting a new initiative related to business or community service.
5.  **Fit Analysis:** Once you have a more refined list, use the `calculate_college_fit` tool to get a detailed fit analysis for each university. This will help you understand your chances and identify areas for improvement. To do that, I will need the university IDs. Would you like me to get a list of all valid university IDs in the knowledge base?

#### ✅ `emphasize_in_application`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> What should I emphasize in my MIT application?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent's response mentions MIT, suggests specific elements to emphasize, and provides strategic advice, thus meeting all criteria.

**Agent Response**:

```
Okay, based on your profile and MIT's competitiveness, here's what you should emphasize in your application:

*   **Quantifiable Achievements:** MIT is highly data-driven. Since your profile doesn't include SAT/ACT scores, it's crucial to highlight quantifiable achievements in your extracurriculars and awards. For example, specify the number of people you led in School Leadership or the impact of your volunteer work at the senior home.
*   **STEM Connection (Even for Business):** While your intended major is Business, MIT is primarily a STEM-focused institution. Emphasize how your activities and interests intersect with technology, innovation, or quantitative analysis. Connect your wellness app (InnerBloom) to the technical skills you used to create it or the data analysis you performed to understand the needs of students with special needs.
*   **Impact and Initiative:** MIT values students who take initiative and create impact. Showcase the impact of your TED Talk, the success of your FBLA competitions, and the reach of Children’s Rights and You America. Quantify the impact whenever possible (e.g., "TED Talk viewed by X people," "InnerBloom used by Y students").
*   **Leadership and Collaboration:** While you have School Leadership listed, elaborate on specific leadership roles and how you collaborated with others to achieve common goals. MIT looks for students who can lead and work effectively in teams.
*   **Authenticity and Passion:** MIT wants to see your genuine passion for your chosen field. Make sure your essays reflect your authentic voice and demonstrate your deep interest in business and related fields. Explain how MIT's unique resources and opportunities will help you achieve your goals.

Since MIT is a "Super Reach" school for almost everyone (4.6% acceptance rate), it's important to present a compelling and unique narrative that showcases your strengths and potential. Good luck!
