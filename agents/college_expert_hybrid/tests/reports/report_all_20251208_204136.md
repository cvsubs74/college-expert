**User Query**:
> Analyze my fit for Harvard

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent's response successfully addressed all criteria by mentioning Harvard, categorizing it as SUPER_REACH, noting the low acceptance rate, and providing specific advice for improving the applicant's chances.

**Agent Response**:

```
Your fit for Harvard University is categorized as **SUPER_REACH**, with a match percentage of 46%. This means admission is exceptionally challenging, and even highly qualified candidates are not guaranteed a spot.

Here's a breakdown of the factors:

*   **GPA Match (12/40):** Your 3.72 GPA is slightly below the typical range for admitted students.
*   **Test Scores (15/25):** Since you are applying test-optional, it's recommended to submit scores if they are strong, as this can help offset other aspects of your application.
*   **Acceptance Rate (2/25):** Harvard's ultra-selective 3.6% acceptance rate significantly impacts this score.
*   **Course Rigor (16/20):** Your 5 AP courses with scores of 4+ demonstrate strong academic rigor.
*   **Major Fit (5/15):** There's a potential concern regarding the direct availability of a "Business" major, and you might need to explore related fields.
*   **Activities (9/15):** Your profile currently lacks listed extracurricular activities and awards, which are important for demonstrating passion, leadership, and impact.
*   **Early Action (10/10):** Applying Early Action (REA) offers a higher acceptance rate (8.74% compared to 3.6% regular), which is favorable.

**Recommendations:**

*   To strengthen your application, it's highly recommended to submit strong standardized test scores if available.
*   More importantly, actively engage in meaningful extracurricular activities that align with your interests, allowing you to develop leadership skills and achieve recognition.
*   Verify the availability of a Business major or consider related fields.
*   Applying Early Action can increase your chances.

#### ✅ `fit_nyu_stern`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> What are my chances at NYU Stern?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The response correctly mentions NYU/New York University and Stern School of Business, providing a fit assessment without failing due to invalid university ID, thus fulfilling all criteria.

**Agent Response**:

```
**NYU Fit Analysis: A Realistic Outlook**

Given NYU's **extremely selective 9.2% acceptance rate**, your profile is categorized as **REACH**, with a **46% match score**. This means that while you have several strengths, admission is highly competitive and not guaranteed. The deterministic scoring highlights that your **GPA of 3.72** is at the 25th percentile for admitted students, and while you have taken **5 AP courses**, which is a positive indicator of academic rigor, the lack of reported scores for these courses prevents a full assessment in that area. The scoring also notes that **Stern may not be directly offered**, which could impact your fit depending on your intended major.

Your **strengths** lie in your academic rigor with 5 AP courses. However, a significant area for consideration is your **lack of extracurricular activities and awards**. For highly selective institutions like NYU, demonstrated passion, leadership, and commitment outside the classroom are crucial components of an application. The scoring also indicates that submitting strong **test scores** (if you have them) could be beneficial, even though NYU is test-optional. Your **Early Action** status also doesn't provide a significant advantage.

To strengthen your application, focus on highlighting any **leadership experiences** you may have, even if they weren't formally tracked as activities. If you have any awards or recognition, ensure they are prominently featured. If you have taken standardized tests (SAT/ACT), consider submitting scores that are at or above the average range for admitted students (if available). Clearly articulate your academic interests and how they align with NYU's specific programs and resources in your essays. Researching and emphasizing your **major fit** will be critical.

```

---

#### ✅ `multi_school_chances`

**Score**: 0.67 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> Analyze my chances at UC Berkeley and USC

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The response discusses both schools and offers a fit assessment, but does not offer a comparison.

**Agent Response**:

```
Based on the information provided:

**UC Berkeley:**
*   **Fit Category:** REACH
*   **Match Percentage:** 50%
*   **Explanation:** Your GPA and course rigor are strong points. However, the lack of standardized test scores and, critically, extracurricular activities are significant areas for improvement for UC Berkeley's highly selective admissions process. It's essential to showcase any leadership roles, volunteer work, or unique projects.

**University of Southern California (USC):**
*   **Fit Category:** REACH
*   **Match Percentage:** 41%
*   **Explanation:** Your course rigor is a positive factor. However, your GPA is slightly below USC's typical range, and the absence of extracurricular activities and awards is a significant concern, as USC highly values well-rounded applicants. It is also recommended to verify if Marketing is directly offered or consider related majors.

**Overall Recommendations for Both Universities:**
*   Highlight any leadership roles, volunteer work, or personal projects in your application.
*   If you have strong standardized test scores, consider submitting them, particularly for USC.

**User Query**:
> Compare the application strategies for UC Berkeley vs USC - what does each school prioritize?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The response successfully discusses Berkeley's and USC's priorities and effectively highlights the differences in what each school values, providing a comprehensive comparison.

**Agent Response**:

```
UC Berkeley and USC, while both highly selective, have distinct priorities and application strategies.

**UC Berkeley**

*   **Type:** Public research university.
*   **Acceptance Rate:** 11%.
*   **Academics:** Very strong academics are essential, with an emphasis on rigorous coursework. They are **Test-Free**, meaning SAT/ACT scores are not considered. The average weighted GPA is around 4.49.
*   **Application Strategy:**
    *   **Major Choice:** If applying to a popular major (like CS or Economics), be aware of its competitiveness. Listing a less competitive alternate major, especially in a different college, can be a strategic move. If undecided, applying undeclared in the College of Letters and Science is common.
    *   **Essays (PIQs):** Specificity, concrete examples with metrics, and demonstrating growth/resilience are key. A balanced narrative across all four PIQs is important.
    *   **Focus:** Showcasing passion, sustained involvement in 1-2 areas, unique perspectives, and contributions to the university.

**USC (University of Southern California)**

*   **Type:** Private research university.
*   **Acceptance Rate:** 9.2%.
*   **Academics:** Strong academics are crucial. They are **Test-Optional**, but strong SAT/ACT scores can be beneficial. The average unweighted GPA is typically between 3.79-4.00.
*   **Application Strategy:**
    *   **Holistic Review:** USC looks at the whole applicant – essays, extracurriculars, recommendations, and personal qualities are weighed heavily alongside academics.
    *   **Essays:** Authenticity and using specific examples to "show, don't tell" are vital. Demonstrate how you fit the "Trojan Family" spirit.
    *   **Extracurriculars:** Highlight leadership, commitment, and impact.
    *   **Major Choice:** For highly competitive schools (like Viterbi, Marshall, Cinematic Arts, Annenberg), having a backup major in a less competitive field can be strategic.
    *   **Focus:** Emphasize passion, initiative, leadership, and impact. They advise against portraying an exclusive focus on entrepreneurship over academic readiness.

**In Summary:**

*   **Berkeley** places a very high emphasis on academic achievement (without test scores) and expects applicants to demonstrate deep, sustained commitment and self-reflection through their essays.
*   **USC** uses a more traditional holistic review, valuing strong academics alongside significant extracurricular involvement, leadership, and a demonstrated fit with their community and values, with test scores still being a potential plus if strong.

### ✅ `fit_analysis_flow`

**Description**: User gets fit analysis and follows up with questions  
**Overall Score**: 0.67 | **Status**: PASSED

#### Conversation Flow

**Turn 1** ✅ (Score: 1.00) 🔗

👤 **User**: Analyze my fit for Stanford

🤖 **Agent**:
```
Stanford University is a **SUPER_REACH** for you, with a match percentage of 34%. This is primarily due to the university's extremely low acceptance rate of 3.6%.

Here's a breakdown of the factors influencing this assessment:

*   **GPA Match:** Your weighted GPA of 3.72 is below the typical academic profile of admitted students.
*   **Acceptance Rate:** Stanford is one of the most selective universities globally.
*   **Course Rigor:** You have completed 5 AP courses, which is a positive factor.
*   **Major Fit:** There might be a discrepancy if you intend to major in Business, as it may not be directly offered.

**Recommendations:**

*   Focus on demonstrating an upward trend in your GPA in the remaining semesters.
*   If you are interested in Business, verify its availability or consider related majors.
*   Given that Stanford is a Super Reach, it's crucial to build a balanced college list with target and safety schools.

Stanford is a highly selective institution that looks for students who excel not only academically but also demonstrate leadership and commitment through extracurricular activities. If you have strong standardized test scores, submitting them would be recommended, especially since the university is test-optional.
```

📋 **Judgment**: The agent provides a relevant fit analysis for Stanford, utilizing data like GPA, AP courses, and acceptance rate. It correctly flags Stanford as a Super Reach and gives recommendations based on the analysis. Since this is the first turn, no context maintenance is needed.

**Turn 2** ✅ (Score: 1.00) 🔗

👤 **User**: Why did you categorize it that way?

🤖 **Agent**:
```
Stanford University was categorized as a **SUPER_REACH** primarily due to its extremely low acceptance rate of 3.6%. Your profile, with a weighted GPA of 3.72, falls below the typical academic profile of students admitted to Stanford.

Additionally, while you have completed 5 AP courses, which demonstrates academic rigor, the evaluation also considers the lack of reported extracurricular activities and awards, as well as any standardized test scores. Stanford, like other highly selective institutions, seeks applicants who show passion, leadership, and commitment through their involvement outside the classroom. The absence of these elements, combined with your GPA, makes admission highly improbable.
```

📋 **Judgment**: The response explains the reasoning behind the categorization of Stanford as a 'SUPER_REACH' school by referencing its low acceptance rate, the user's GPA, and the lack of reported extracurricular activities and standardized test scores. It fulfills both criteria.

**Turn 3** ❌ (Score: 0.00) 🔗

👤 **User**: What can I do to improve my chances?

🤖 **Agent**:
```
To provide you with personalized advice on improving your chances at Stanford, I need to access your student profile. Could you please share your email address?
```

📋 **Judgment**: The response does not provide improvement suggestions, and it doesn't relate any advice to Stanford specifically. It asks for the user's email address, which is a potential privacy concern and doesn't address the user's question.

```
I can help you find safety schools, but I need a little more information about your academic profile. Could you please tell me your GPA, test scores (if any), and any significant extracurricular activities or awards you have? This will help me recommend schools that are a good match for you.
```

📋 **Judgment**: The agent recognized the need to suggest safety schools, but correctly determined that more information was needed before specific schools could be recommended. It therefore did not give specific recommendations (not fully met criterion 1) but asked for details to properly make the recommendation (met criterion 2).

**Turn 3** ✅ (Score: 1.00) 🔗

👤 **User**: How about reach schools?

🤖 **Agent**:
```
I can help you identify reach schools, but I need to understand your profile first. Could you please share your GPA, test scores, and any notable extracurricular activities or awards you have? This information will allow me to provide a more accurate assessment and recommendations.
```

📋 **Judgment**: The agent identifies that the user wants to switch to the discussion of reach schools and asks for information about the student to make appropriate recommendations. While the agent does not directly reference the previous discussion about saftey schools, it implicitly maintains context by attempting to build a profile.

**Turn 4** ✅ (Score: 1.00) 🔗

👤 **User**: Between those options, which would you prioritize?

🤖 **Agent**:
```
These three universities (UC Berkeley, USC, and Carnegie Mellon) are all highly selective and competitive. Your previous fit analysis categorized all of them as "REACH" schools. This means that while admission is possible, it is not guaranteed, and your chances are lower compared to "TARGET" or "SAFETY" schools.

When deciding which to prioritize, consider these factors:

*   **Acceptance Rates:** USC has the lowest acceptance rate at 9.2%, followed closely by UC Berkeley at 11% and Carnegie Mellon at 11.6%. This suggests USC is the most difficult to get into based on numbers alone.
*   **Testing Policies:** UC Berkeley is test-free, so your SAT/ACT scores won't be a factor. USC and CMU are test-optional, meaning you can choose whether to submit scores. If you have strong scores for USC (1420-1540 SAT, 31-34 ACT) or CMU (1500-1560 SAT, 34-35 ACT), submitting them could potentially strengthen your application. However, if your scores are not in that range, it might be better not to submit them for these test-optional schools.
*   **GPA:** All have very high GPA expectations. UC Berkeley reports the highest average weighted GPA (4.49), while CMU's average unweighted GPA is 3.89. Your GPA should be considered in relation to these averages.
*   **Top Majors:** All three have very strong programs in Computer Science and Engineering. If your intended major is one of these, competition will be particularly fierce. If you are interested in other majors like Business, Economics, or Biological Sciences, research the specific strengths and rankings of those departments at each university.

**To prioritize, I would need more information about your specific interests and profile:**

1.  **Intended Major:** Which major are you most interested in, and how does each university's program align with your goals?
2.  **Campus Culture/Environment:** Do you prefer a large public university feel (UC Berkeley), a private university in a major city (USC), or a more focused, tech-oriented environment (CMU)?
3.  **Location:** Do you have a preference for California (UC Berkeley, USC) versus Pennsylvania (CMU)?
4.  **Test Scores:** If you have strong SAT/ACT scores, USC and CMU might be slightly more appealing as they allow you to use those scores.

Once you provide more details about your preferences, I can offer a more tailored recommendation on which of these "REACH" schools might be a slightly better fit or a higher priority for your application strategy.
```

📋 **Judgment**: The response directly references the discussed schools (UC Berkeley, USC, Carnegie Mellon) and provides a detailed comparison to help prioritize them, considering factors like acceptance rates, testing policies, and GPA. It also requests more information for a tailored recommendation, indicating an understanding of the user's need for prioritization advice.
