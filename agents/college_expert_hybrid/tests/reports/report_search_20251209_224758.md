**Agent Response**:

```
Both UC Berkeley and UCLA have strong computer science programs and are highly competitive. While I don't have specific career outcome data in my knowledge base to directly compare the two, both universities are highly regarded by employers. UC Berkeley's EECS program is known for its rigor and research focus, while UCLA's programs offer a strong foundation in both theory and practical applications. To get a better understanding of career outcomes, I recommend checking university websites, LinkedIn, and other resources for alumni career paths and employer information.

#### ❌ `compare_strategy_berkeley_usc`

**Score**: 0.00 | **Status**: FAILED

**User Query**:
> Compare the application strategies for UC Berkeley vs USC - what does each school prioritize?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent fails to discuss the priorities of either school, instead providing basic information and suggesting further research.

**Agent Response**:

```
Here's a comparison of application strategies for UC Berkeley and USC, based on my knowledge base:

**UC Berkeley:**

*   **Location:** Berkeley, CA
*   **Acceptance Rate:** 11%

**USC (University of Southern California):**

*   **Location:** Los Angeles, CA
*   **Acceptance Rate:** 9.2%
*   **Known For:** Film school, business school, and strong academics.

To provide a more detailed comparison of application strategies, I need to access more specific information about what each school prioritizes in its admission process. I can use the DeepResearchAgent to find more nuanced information about each university's values, culture, and recent news. Would you like me to do that?
