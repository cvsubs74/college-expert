## 📖 Detailed Test Results

### 🏷️ Strategic Recommendations

#### ✅ `safety_schools`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> Based on my profile, which universities should I consider as safety schools?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent provides specific university recommendations based on the student's profile and gives reasons for the safety designation based on acceptance rates and program strengths.

**Agent Response**:

```
Based on your profile, here are some universities with strong business programs that could be considered safety schools:

*   **Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech)**: The Pamplin College of Business offers strong programs in Accounting, Finance, Marketing, and Business Information Technology. With an acceptance rate of around 55%, your academic profile and involvement should make you a competitive applicant.

*   **Texas A&M University**: Mays Business School is well-regarded for its Accounting, Finance, Marketing, and Management Information Systems programs. Their overall acceptance rate is about 57%, and your academic achievements position you well.

*   **University of Connecticut (UConn)**: The School of Business has competitive internal transfer requirements (a 3.3 GPA), and an overall acceptance rate of approximately 52.4%. This makes UConn a solid option given your strong academic standing.

*   **Indiana University Bloomington**: While not directly found in the initial search, Indiana University's Kelley School of Business is highly respected. With an acceptance rate between 45-50%, your profile makes you a strong candidate.

*   **Wake Forest University**: While its acceptance rate is around 21.5%, making it less of a traditional safety school, Wake Forest has excellent business programs and a holistic admissions process. Their emphasis on community service ('Pro Humanitate') aligns well with your profile, making it a viable option to consider.

To make the best decision, I recommend researching the specific business programs, campus culture, and admission preferences for each university.

UC San Diego values academic excellence, leadership, and a demonstrated interest in a student's chosen field. Based on your profile, here are the aspects that would strengthen your application:

**Academic Strengths:**

#### ✅ `balanced_list_business`

**User Query**:
> Help me build a balanced college list for Business majors in California

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent successfully created a balanced college list with reach, target and safety schools focused on business programs in California.

**Agent Response**:

```
Based on your academic profile and extracurricular activities, here is a balanced college list with a focus on Business majors in California. I've aimed for a mix of selectivity and program strength, considering your GPA, AP scores, and leadership experience in areas like FBLA and school organizations. 

**Top Tier / Reach Schools:**

*   **University of California, Berkeley (Haas School of Business):** Highly competitive, known for its rigorous business program and strong ties to the tech and finance industries. Your strong AP scores and leadership experience are assets here.
*   **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) (The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science - Management Science):** While not a traditional business school, UCLA offers strong management-related programs. Your quantitative skills from AP Calculus BC and AP Chemistry could be beneficial.
*   **University of Southern California (Marshall School of Business):** A top private business school with a strong reputation. Your involvement in FBLA and leadership roles align well with their focus on experiential learning and global business.

**Mid-Tier / Target Schools:**

*   **University of California, Davis (Graduate School of Management - Undergraduate Business Program):** Offers a well-regarded undergraduate business program with a strong emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship. Your participation in TEDx DVHS and the wellness app development show initiative.
*   **University of California, Irvine (Paul Merage School of Business):** Known for its strong programs in entrepreneurship, technology, and healthcare management. Your experience with the wellness app and research paper could be relevant.
*   **University of California, San Diego (UCSD) (Rady School of Management - Undergraduate Business Program):** A newer but rapidly growing business program, particularly strong in areas related to technology and innovation. Your AP scores and interest in social impact (Children's Rights and You America) could be a good fit.

**Lower-Tier / Safety Schools:**

*   **California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly SLO) (Orfalea College of Business):** Offers a strong business program with a focus on practical application and hands-on learning. Your Teacher's Assistant experience and leadership roles would be beneficial.
*   **California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) (College of Business):** A large, comprehensive business school with a variety of specializations. Your diverse extracurriculars could be well-utilized here.
*   **San Jose State University (Lucas College of Business):** Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, offering strong connections to the tech industry. Your interest in technology and innovation, as demonstrated by your app development, would be a great asset.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **UC System Application:** Remember that for UC schools, you apply to the university as a whole and then indicate your major of interest. Some UC business programs are impacted, meaning they are more competitive.
*   **Private vs. Public:** Your list includes both public (UCs, CSUs) and private (USC) institutions, offering different financial aid and admission structures.
*   **Program Focus:** While all are business-related, research the specific concentrations or specializations within each school's business program to ensure they align with your interests (e.g., entrepreneurship, finance, marketing, management).

This list provides a starting point. It's crucial to delve deeper into each university's specific program requirements, campus culture, and career services to make the best choice for your goals.
