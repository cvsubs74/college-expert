#### ✅ `interdisciplinary_marketing_psychology`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> I want to study Marketing and Psychology - which universities have programs that combine both?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent successfully identified universities offering both Marketing and Psychology programs, and provided helpful guidance on combining them.

**Agent Response**:

```
Here are some universities that offer programs combining Marketing and Psychology:

*   **Pamplin College of Business** at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University: This college offers a Marketing major and has programs within its other colleges that may align with Psychology interests.
*   **College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences** at Virginia Tech: This college houses Psychology programs, and interdisciplinary study is encouraged.
*   **College of Science** at Virginia Tech: This college offers Psychology programs and related science fields that could be combined with Marketing.
*   **Rutgers University-New Brunswick**: Offers a Psychology major within the School of Arts and Sciences and a Marketing major within the Rutgers Business School.
*   **Lehigh University**: Has both Psychology programs within the College of Arts and Sciences and Marketing programs within the College of Arts and Sciences.
*   **Indiana University Bloomington**: Offers Psychology programs in the College of Arts and Sciences and Marketing programs in the Kelley School of Business.
*   **University of Colorado Boulder**: Provides Psychology programs within the College of Arts and Sciences and has business programs that might include Marketing concentrations.
*   **Southern Methodist University**: Offers Psychology programs in Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences and Marketing within the Cox School of Business.

When considering these options, it's worth noting that many universities allow students to double major or combine programs from different colleges or schools, which could be an effective way to pursue both Marketing and Psychology. I recommend checking the specific program requirements and course catalogs for each university to see how these fields can be best integrated.
