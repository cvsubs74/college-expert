The UC system offers a wide range of highly competitive engineering programs across its campuses. Admission and internal transfer requirements can be very stringent, often demanding high GPAs in specific prerequisite courses.

Here's a general overview:

*   **University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB):** Offers programs in Computer Science, Mechanical, Electrical, Computer, and Chemical Engineering. Internal transfers are competitive and have specific GPA and course requirements.
*   **University of Southern California (USC) - Viterbi School of Engineering:** Has strong programs in Computer Science, Mechanical, Biomedical, Electrical, Aerospace, Chemical, Computer Engineering, Environmental, and Industrial and Systems Engineering. Internal transfers are possible but competitive, with GPA requirements varying by major.
*   **University of California, Berkeley (UCB):** Known for its extremely competitive College of Engineering, particularly Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS). Admission is often direct to the major, and internal transfers from other colleges are generally not permitted or highly limited.
*   **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA):** The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS) offers popular majors like Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Bioengineering, and Materials Science and Engineering. Internal transfers are possible but highly competitive.
*   **California Institute of Technology (Caltech):** Offers rigorous programs in Chemical, Computer Science, Electrical, Mechanical, Applied and Computational Mathematics, and Materials Science. Caltech's programs are exceptionally demanding, with specific GPA requirements for option subjects.
*   **University of California, Irvine (UCI):** The Henry Samueli School of Engineering has competitive programs in Computer Science, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical, Biomedical, Mechanical, Chemical, Civil, Environmental, and Materials Science and Engineering. Internal transfers have strict GPA and unit requirements.
*   **University of California, Davis (UCD):** The College of Engineering offers impacted majors like Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Chemical Engineering. Internal transfers require strong performance in prerequisite courses.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I highly recommend visiting the official admissions websites for each UC campus and program you're interested in.

#### ❌ `mit_admission_requirements`

**Score**: 0.00 | **Status**: FAILED

**User Query**:
> What are the admission requirements for MIT?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent failed to provide any information regarding MIT admission requirements.

**Agent Response**:

```
I am sorry, but I cannot fulfill this request. The available tools lack the functionality to search for specific admission requirements like GPA, test scores, or prerequisite courses for MIT. I can only search for general university information. Would you like me to search for information on similar schools?

#### ❌ `mit_acceptance_rate`

**Score**: 0.00 | **Status**: FAILED

**User Query**:
> What is the acceptance rate at MIT?

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent returned an error, so none of the criteria were met.

**Agent Response**:

```
Error: 500 - Internal Server Error

#### ✅ `ucla_requirements`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> Tell me about UCLA's application requirements and deadlines

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The response mentions UCLA, discusses application requirements and deadlines, and provides actionable information about GPA, testing policy, essay strategy, and key dates.

**Agent Response**:

```
Based on the information gathered, here's what I found regarding application requirements and deadlines for UCLA:

**UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles)**

*   **Acceptance Rate:** Approximately 9% (highly selective).
*   **Academics:**
    *   **GPA:** Average weighted GPA of 4.31, with middle 50% unweighted GPA of 3.90-4.00 and weighted GPA of 4.18-4.32. Most admitted students have nearly straight A's in honors/AP courses.
    *   **Testing:** UCLA is **test-blind**, meaning SAT/ACT scores are *not* considered for admission, even if submitted.
*   **Application Strategy:**
    *   **Major Selection:** UCLA admits students into specific colleges and then into majors. For high-demand majors like Computer Science (Engineering), consider listing a less competitive, genuinely interested alternate major in a different college (e.g., Cognitive Science in Letters and Science).
    *   **Essays:** Essays (Personal Insight Questions) are crucial. Be specific, use concrete examples, focus on your growth and contributions, and showcase your personality. Avoid clichés and generic topics.
*   **Deadlines:** While specific deadlines are not detailed in this search result, as a UC school, typical application windows are:
    *   **Application Open:** August 1st
    *   **Application Submission:** November 1st - November 30th (for Fall admission)
    *   **Notification of Admission:** Typically by the end of March for freshman applicants.
    *   **Statement of Intent to Register (SIR):** Typically by May 1st.

**Key Takeaways for Applicants:**

*   **Academic Excellence:** Focus on maintaining a strong GPA and taking challenging courses.
*   **Authentic Essays:** Your essays are your chance to tell your story and show your personality, passion, and growth.
*   **Research Programs:** If you're interested in specific programs or colleges, research their unique requirements and opportunities.

It is highly recommended to visit the official UCLA Admissions website for the most up-to-date and precise information on application requirements and deadlines for the specific academic year you plan to apply.
