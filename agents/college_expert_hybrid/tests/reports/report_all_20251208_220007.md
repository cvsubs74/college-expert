> The agent correctly identifies and provides detailed admission information for MIT, also suggesting further questions.

**Agent Response**:

```
MIT's admission requirements emphasize a holistic review, considering academic excellence alongside passion, curiosity, initiative, impact, and character.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Academic Profile:**
    *   **GPA:** An average weighted GPA of 4.19 is typical, with most admitted students having nearly straight A's in rigorous coursework, including AP or IB classes.
    *   **Class Rank:** 99% of admitted students who submitted rank were in the top 10% of their class, and 100% were in the top quarter.
    *   **Coursework:** A strong secondary school record with challenging courses is expected.
*   **Standardized Tests:**
    *   **SAT:** The middle 50% range is 1520-1580.
    *   **ACT:** The middle 50% range is 34-36.
*   **Admissions Strategy:**
    *   **Essays:** These should be specific and authentic, demonstrating why MIT appeals to you and connecting your interests to their programs or faculty. Showing your experiences and qualities is encouraged.
    *   **Extracurriculars:** Depth in one or two areas of interest is preferred over scattered participation. MIT values significant accomplishments and the pursuit of genuine interests, with leadership roles, research, and STEM competition participation being highly regarded.
    *   **Fit:** It's crucial to demonstrate a genuine fit with MIT's innovative and problem-solving culture.

MIT does not admit students to specific majors directly. All students are admitted to the university and declare their major after their first year. However, for fields like Computer Science and Engineering, a strong foundation in math and science is essential.

For the most detailed and up-to-date information, I recommend visiting the official MIT Admissions website.

**Agent Response**:

```
I found some information about financial aid at MIT. MIT does not release specific financial aid statistics, but it is known for its generous financial aid program. All financial aid is need-based, and the university meets 100% of demonstrated financial need for all admitted students, including international students. This means that families can expect to pay an amount they can afford, and MIT will cover the rest through grants, scholarships, and sometimes student loans or work-study.

MIT's "EduFinance" website provides a Net Price Calculator, which can help families estimate their potential cost of attendance based on their specific financial circumstances. Additionally, the university offers various resources and workshops on financial literacy and aid application processes.

### 🏷️ Personalized Analysis

#### ✅ `fit_berkeley`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> Analyze my fit for UC Berkeley

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent's response meets all four criteria by mentioning UC Berkeley, providing a fit category, referencing the student's profile, and giving actionable advice.

**Agent Response**:

```
The fit analysis for UC Berkeley indicates a **REACH** category with a **50% match**. This means that while admission is possible, it is not guaranteed, and Berkeley should be considered a reach school for you.

Your academic preparation, including your GPA and AP courses, is a strength. However, the analysis highlights a lack of standardized test scores and, more significantly, a lack of extracurricular activities. For highly selective universities like UC Berkeley, demonstrating engagement and commitment outside of academics through extracurriculars is crucial.

To improve your application, focus on:
*   Highlighting any leadership roles or significant contributions within your academic work.
*   Detailing any volunteer work or personal projects that showcase initiative and interests.
*   Submitting test scores if available, as they can still be a factor in holistic review despite many UCs being test-blind.

It is also recommended to apply to a range of schools, including those that may be a better fit or safety options, to ensure you have strong choices.

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent successfully addressed all the criteria by mentioning Harvard, categorizing it as a SUPER_REACH, mentioning its low acceptance rate, and providing advice for improving chances.

**Agent Response**:

```
Your profile places you in the **SUPER_REACH** category for Harvard University, with a calculated fit score of 69 out of a possible 150. This is due to Harvard's extremely low acceptance rate of 3.6%, making it an ultra-selective institution.

**Key factors contributing to your fit score:**

*   **GPA Match (12/40):** Your 3.72 GPA is slightly below the typical range for admitted students.
*   **Test Scores (15/25):** While Harvard is test-optional, submitting strong scores could be beneficial.
*   **Acceptance Rate (2/25):** The 3.6% acceptance rate significantly impacts the 'reach' category.
*   **Course Rigor (16/20):** You have a strong academic background with 5 AP courses and 5 scores of 4+.
*   **Major Fit (5/15):** Business may not be directly offered, so verifying program availability or considering related majors is recommended.
*   **Activities (9/15):** Your leadership experience is a positive factor.
*   **Early Action (10/10):** Applying through Restrictive Early Action (REA) offers a slightly higher chance of admission compared to regular decision.

**Recommendations:**

*   Verify the availability of a Business major or explore related fields at Harvard.
*   Consider applying through Restrictive Early Action (REA) to potentially improve your chances.

**Agent Response**:

```
NYU is a competitive school, and your profile is currently considered a **REACH** for you, with a **46% match score**. This means admission is possible but not probable.

Here's a breakdown of the factors contributing to this assessment:

*   **GPA:** Your 3.72 GPA is at the 25th percentile for admitted students, which is a significant challenge for NYU.
*   **Acceptance Rate:** NYU has a very low acceptance rate of 9.2%.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Match Percentage:** 47%
*   **GPA:** Your GPA is at the 25th percentile for admitted students.
*   **Test Scores:** While not mandatory for all applicants, submitting scores would strengthen your application, as your profile currently lacks them.
*   **Acceptance Rate:** MIT's overall acceptance rate is extremely low at 4.6%, making it highly competitive.
*   **Course Rigor:** You have a strong academic background with 5 AP courses and scores of 4 or 5, which aligns well with MIT's expectations.
*   **Major Fit:** Your intended major is well-represented at MIT.
*   **Activities and Awards:** This is an area where your profile could be strengthened. MIT looks for students who demonstrate passion and leadership beyond academics. Your profile currently lists no extracurricular activities or awards.

#### ✅ `multi_school_chances`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> Analyze my chances at UC Berkeley and USC

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent addresses both schools, provides a fit assessment for each, and offers a brief comparison.

**Agent Response**:

```
Here's an analysis of your chances at UC Berkeley and USC:

**UC Berkeley:**
*   **Category:** REACH
*   **Match Percentage:** 50%
*   **Explanation:** Your GPA and the number of AP courses you've taken are positive factors. However, UC Berkeley is highly selective. The lack of standardized test scores (while many UCs are test-blind, it can still play a role in holistic review) and, more significantly, a lack of demonstrated extracurricular activities are notable weaknesses. For top-tier universities like Berkeley, showcasing involvement and passion outside of academics is crucial.
*   **Recommendations:** Highlight any leadership roles or significant contributions from your AP courses or other projects. Detail any volunteer work or personal projects to showcase initiative.

**University of Southern California (USC):**
*   **Category:** REACH
*   **Match Percentage:** 41%
*   **Explanation:** Your course rigor with 5 AP courses is a strength. However, your GPA of 3.72 is slightly below USC's typical admitted student range. The absence of standardized test scores means your application relies heavily on other factors, and a lack of extracurricular activities and awards is a significant concern, as USC values well-rounded individuals. Additionally, 'Marketing' may not be a directly offered major, which could impact your application's alignment.
*   **Recommendations:** If you have strong standardized test scores, consider submitting them. Focus on highlighting any leadership or unique experiences, even if not formally structured activities. Clearly articulate your passion for your intended field of study and explain how USC's specific programs align with your goals.

**Overall:** Both UC Berkeley and USC are considered **REACH** schools for your profile. It is highly recommended to focus on strengthening your application by elaborating on any experiences that showcase your initiative, leadership, and passions. Ensure you have a balanced list of reach, target, and safety schools.

### ✅ `fit_analysis_flow`

**Description**: User gets fit analysis and follows up with questions  
**Overall Score**: 0.83 | **Status**: PASSED

#### Conversation Flow

**Turn 1** ❌ (Score: 0.50) 🔗

👤 **User**: Analyze my fit for Stanford

🤖 **Agent**:
```
Stanford University is a SUPER_REACH for you. This means admission is highly unlikely, even with a strong application.

Here's a breakdown of the factors contributing to this assessment:

*   **Acceptance Rate:** Stanford's extremely low 3.6% acceptance rate makes it one of the most selective universities globally.
*   **GPA:** Your 3.72 GPA is below the typical range for admitted students.
*   **Major:** Business may not be directly offered, which could impact your fit for specific programs.
*   **Extracurriculars & Awards:** A lack of demonstrated leadership, significant extracurricular activities, and awards is a major concern for a highly selective institution like Stanford.

While your GPA is solid and you've taken AP courses, these factors are weighed against a pool of exceptionally qualified applicants.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Extracurriculars:** Focus on developing a few meaningful extracurricular activities where you can demonstrate leadership and impact. Deep engagement in one or two is more valuable than superficial involvement in many.
*   **Academics:** Continue to excel academically and explore your interests deeply.
*   **Major Verification:** Verify the availability of a Business major or consider related fields.
*   **Test Scores:** If you have strong standardized test scores, consider submitting them, as Stanford is currently test-optional.
*   **Upward Trend:** Focus on showing an upward trend in your remaining semesters.
```

📋 **Judgment**: The response provides a fit analysis for Stanford but does not use any provided student profile data (as none was provided in the initial turn). It offers general advice but is missing crucial information to analyze the *user's* specific fit.

**Turn 2** ✅ (Score: 1.00) 🔗

👤 **User**: Why did you categorize it that way?

🤖 **Agent**:
```
Stanford University was categorized as a SUPER_REACH due to a combination of factors, primarily its extremely low acceptance rate (3.6%) and your current academic profile not aligning with the typical admitted student's metrics.

Specifically:

*   **Acceptance Rate:** Stanford is among the most selective universities in the world, making admission highly competitive for everyone.
*   **GPA:** Your 3.72 GPA is below the average for students admitted to Stanford.
*   **Extracurriculars & Awards:** A significant factor is the lack of demonstrated leadership and substantial extracurricular involvement. Highly selective schools like Stanford look for students who have pursued their interests with passion and leadership outside the classroom.
*   **Major Fit:** There's a potential mismatch with the Business major, as it might not be directly offered or could be highly competitive.

While your academic preparation (AP courses) is a positive, these other factors indicate that Stanford is a very ambitious choice, hence the "SUPER_REACH" categorization. The goal of this categorization is to provide a realistic assessment of your chances based on the available data.
```

📋 **Judgment**: The response clearly explains the reasoning for categorizing Stanford as a "SUPER_REACH" and references specific factors from the analysis, including acceptance rate, GPA, extracurriculars, and major fit.

**Turn 3** ✅ (Score: 1.00) 🔗

👤 **User**: What can I do to improve my chances?

🤖 **Agent**:
```
To improve your chances at highly selective universities like Stanford, focus on these key areas:

*   **Demonstrate Leadership and Impact:** Engage deeply in a few extracurricular activities. Aim for positions where you can take initiative, lead others, and make a tangible impact. This shows commitment and passion beyond just participation.
*   **Academic Excellence:** Continue to achieve high grades and challenge yourself with rigorous coursework. If your GPA has an upward trend, that can be a positive signal.
*   **Standardized Test Scores (If applicable):** While many universities are test-optional, strong scores can still bolster your application. If you have competitive scores, consider submitting them.
*   **Major Exploration and Fit:** Research specific programs thoroughly. If your intended major is highly competitive or not directly offered, explore related fields or alternative universities that have strong programs in your area of interest.

For Stanford specifically, consider:

*   **Verifying Business Program Details:** Understand the exact offerings and admission requirements for Business-related studies.
*   **Showcasing Unique Qualities:** Highly selective schools often look for applicants who bring unique perspectives or talents. Think about what makes you stand out and how you can convey that in your application.

Remember, even with a near-perfect profile, admission to these institutions is incredibly competitive. It's also wise to build a balanced college list that includes reach, target, and safety schools.
```

📋 **Judgment**: The response provides specific and actionable advice to improve chances of admission, with clear suggestions for both general improvements and those specifically tailored to Stanford. The advice covers extracurriculars, academics, test scores (with appropriate caveats), and exploration of major/fit. It also considers unique qualities that Stanford might value.
