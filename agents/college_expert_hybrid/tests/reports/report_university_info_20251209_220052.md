#### ✅ `ucla_requirements`

**Score**: 1.00 | **Status**: PASSED

**User Query**:
> Tell me about UCLA's application requirements and deadlines

**Judge Reasoning**:
> The agent mentions UCLA, discusses application requirements and deadlines, and provides actionable information by suggesting the user visit the UCLA admissions website.

**Agent Response**:

```
I found some information about UCLA application requirements and deadlines, but it's spread across multiple entries. I can summarize the general requirements, but for specific deadlines, you'll want to check the UCLA admissions website directly.

Here's what I found:

*   **Academics:** Most admitted students have straight A's in honors/AP courses, with nearly 60% having a 4.0 unweighted GPA. UCLA is test-blind, so standardized test scores are not considered.
*   **Holistic Review:** UCLA uses a holistic review process.
*   **Acceptance Rate:** The undergraduate acceptance rate is approximately 9%.

To get the exact application deadlines, I recommend visiting the UCLA admissions website.
