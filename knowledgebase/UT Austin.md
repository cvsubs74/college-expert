A Comprehensive Admissions Research
 Report: The University of Texas, Austin
**I. The UT Austin Admissions Landscape: An
 Institutional Analysis**

An examination of the admissions environment at The University of Texas at Austin reveals a
 complex, multi-faceted institution operating under unique pressures.
Its identity as a "Public
 Ivy"¹, combined with binding state-level mandates, has created a bifurcated admissions
 model that requires distinct strategic approaches from different applicant pools.

**A. Institutional Identity and Market Position**

The University of Texas at Austin is positioned as the premier public university in its state,
 ranked as the #1 public university in Texas and the #7 public university in the United States.2
 This elite academic standing is supported by numerous top-ranked programs, including the
 #1-ranked Engineering Program in Texas, the #6 Undergraduate Business Program, and the
 #10 Computer Science Program nationally.
This brand strength and academic reputation
 create a powerful draw, attracting a massive volume of applications from top-tier students
 both domestically and internationally.
This high demand exists in direct tension with the
 university's primary mission as a state-funded institution, a conflict that fundamentally shapes
 its admissions policies.

**B. The Bifurcated Admissions Model: In-State vs. Out-of-State
 Selectivity**

The single most critical structural factor governing UT Austin admissions is a state law
 mandating that 90% of the first-year enrolled class must be residents of Texas.
This policy
 effectively splits the applicant pool into two distinct, non-competing cohorts with dramatically
 different statistical profiles.
The overall acceptance rate of approximately 29% 3 is a statistical composite and should be
 considered misleading for strategic planning.
The 90/10 mandate creates two separate,
 starkly different acceptance rates:

* **In-State Acceptance Rate:** 40.97% 3
* **Out-of-State Acceptance Rate:** 11.76% 3

For a non-Texan applicant, UT Austin is not a 29% acceptance rate institution; it is an 11.76%
 acceptance rate institution.
This places its out-of-state (OOS) selectivity in a category on par
 with Ivy League or other highly selective private universities.
This reality fundamentally alters
 the "safety/match/reach" calculation for all OOS applicants, for whom UT Austin must be
 categorized as a "High Reach" regardless of their academic profile.

**Context:** A Comprehensive Admissions Research Report: The University of Texas, Austin > I. The UT Austin Admissions Landscape: An Institutional Analysis > The Application Surge and Strategic Impact

**C. The Application Surge: Unsustainable Growth and Its Strategic
 Impact**

In recent years, UT Austin has experienced an exponential surge in applications, far outpacing
 its deliberate, limited enrollment growth.
This trend is accelerating:

* **Fall 2024:** The university received a record 72,885 freshman applications.5
* **Fall 2025:** The university shattered its previous record, receiving 90,562 freshman
 applications.8
This represents a 24.3% increase in applications in a single cycle.
The growth among
 non-residents was even more pronounced, with OOS applications soaring by 48%.8

In contrast, the university's enrolled class size is growing at a much slower, controlled pace.
The Fall 2024 entering class was $9,210^{5},$ and the Fall 2025 class was 9,900.
A Senior Vice
 Provost for Strategic Enrollment Management confirmed that the university has "deliberately
 limited growth" to maintain quality and resources.
This mathematical divergence-a rapidly expanding applicant pool competing for a relatively
 static number of seats-forces the acceptance rate to plummet.
This application pressure is a
 primary driver behind two recent, significant strategic shifts by the university:

1.  **Reinstatement of Standardized Testing:** As stated by the university president, with an
 "abundance of high school GPAs surrounding 4.0," the university required a "proven
 differentiator".
10 Standardized test scores were reinstated as a tool to manage this
 high-achieving pool.
2.  **Increased Reliance on Major-Specific Requirements:** The admissions model is
 increasingly reliant on "silos."
Specific requirements for engineering, business, or
 architecture function as critical first-pass filters to reduce the applicant pool before a full
 holistic review.
The process is shifting from one of qualification ("Is this applicant good
 enough?") to one of intense competition ("Is this applicant demonstrably stronger than
 the other 50 qualified applicants for this single spot?").

**Context:** A Comprehensive Admissions Research Report: The University of Texas, Austin > II. Freshman Admissions Profile: A Multi-Year Statistical Review > Application, Admission, and Enrollment Trends

**II. Freshman Admissions Profile: A Multi-Year
 Statistical Review**

Quantitative analysis of recent admissions cycles provides clear academic benchmarks for
 prospective applicants and illustrates the statistical impact of the trends identified in the
 previous section.

**A. Application, Admission, and Enrollment Trends (Fall 2022-2024)**

The following table synthesizes institutional data to show the relationship between application
 volume, admissions, and enrollment.

**Table 1: Freshman Application & Enrollment Statistics (Fall 2022-2024)**

| Metric | Fall 2022 (2022-23) | Fall 2023 (2023-24) | Fall 2024 (2024-25) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Total Applications | $59,767^{4}$ | $66,109^{4}$ | $72,885^{5}$ |
| Total Admits | $18,770^{4}$ | $19,253^{4}$ | $19,417^{13}$ |
| Total Enrolled | $9,109^{4}$ | $9,385^{4}$ | $9,210^{5}$ |
| Acceptance Rate | $\sim31.4\%^{4}$ | ~29.1% 4 | ~26.6% (Calculated) |
| Yield Rate | ~48.5% 4 | $\sim48.7\%^{\circ}/_{0}^{4}$ | ~47.4% (Calculated) |

A key indicator of institutional prestige is the high yield rate, which has held steady near 49%.
For a large public university with an admit pool of over 19,000 students, this figure is
 exceptionally high.
It demonstrates that UT Austin is not a "backup school" but rather the first
 choice for the majority of students it admits, even when they have offers from other elite
 institutions.
This high yield affords the university confidence that its offers will be accepted,
 reducing the need to "over-admit" or pull heavily from a waitlist, which in turn amplifies its
 selectivity.

---

**Context:** A Comprehensive Admissions Research Report: The University of Texas, Austin > II. Freshman Admissions Profile: A Multi-Year Statistical Review > Admitted Freshman Academic Profile and Testing Policy

**B. Admitted Freshman Academic Profile (Enrolled Fall 2024)**

The academic credentials of the enrolled freshman class establish a clear benchmark for
 competitiveness.

**Table 2: Admitted Freshman Academic Profile (Enrolled Fall 2024)**

| Metric | Middle 50% Range | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GPA | 3.75-4.0 | UT Austin does not publicize GPA data in its Common Data Set 1; this range is from external analysis.3 |
| SAT Composite | 1230-1480 | 13 |
| SAT Reading | 620-730 | 13 |
| SAT Math | 610-770 | 13 |
| ACT Composite | $29-34$ | 13 |

These ranges reflect a period of test-optional admissions. With the policy change, these
 figures are expected to solidify or rise.

**C. The Reinstatement of Standardized Testing (Fall 2025 and Beyond)**

The university will require all freshman applicants to submit SAT or ACT scores for Fall 2025
 admission and beyond, ending a four-year test-optional period.
10 This decision was based on
 the university's internal analysis of student performance.
This analysis provides a clear window into the university's strategic thinking 10:

* For Fall 2024, 42% of applicants "opted in" to have scores considered.
* The median SAT score for applicants who "opted in" was 1420.
* The median SAT score for applicants who did not submit scores (but took an exam) was
 1160.
* Most critically, students who "opted in" had an average first-semester college GPA that
 was 0.86 grade points higher than non-submitters, even after controlling for high
 school rank and GPA.

This data proved to the administration that standardized scores are a strong predictor of
 success at UT Austin.
The university's public statement that scores are a "proven
 differentiator" 10 confirms that the SAT/ACT will not be a simple checkbox.
It is being
 re-implemented as a primary tool for differentiation, especially for sorting auto-admit
 students with high GPAs into competitive, high-demand majors.
A high score will be viewed as
 a sign of lower institutional risk and a higher probability of success.

**III. The Application Gauntlet: Key Dates,
 Requirements, and Strategic Considerations**

This section provides a definitive timeline and checklist for the Fall 2026 admissions cycle,
 based on the most recent available data.

**A. General Application Requirements (All Freshman Applicants)**

All freshman applicants must submit the following materials to be considered for admission 14:

* **Application Platform:** The Common Application. 14
* **Application Fee:** A non-refundable \$75 fee. 14
* **Essay and Short Answers:** Applicants must submit one essay and all required short
 answer prompts. 14
* **Standardized Test Scores:** Official SAT or ACT scores must be submitted. 14
* **Transcripts and Class Rank:** An official high school transcript listing all coursework from
 9th-11th grade and class rank is required.
14
* **Optional Materials:** Up to two letters of recommendation may be submitted but are not
 required. 15

**B. Fall 2026 Application & Financial Aid Deadlines**

The following timeline synthesizes all critical deadlines for admission, financial aid, and
 scholarships.

**Table 3: Fall 2026 Freshman Application & Financial Aid Deadlines**

| Milestone | Deadline | Significance / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Application Opens | August 1, 2025 | 14 |
| Early Action Deadline | October 15, 2025 | 14 Non-binding. Guarantees an earlier decision. |
| Regular Application Deadline | December 1, 2025 | 14 This is the final, hard deadline for all freshman applicants, including for selective majors and premier scholarships. |
| Supplemental Materials Deadline | December 10, 2025 | 14 For general materials (e.g., transcripts). Major-specific portfolios or supplements are typically due December 1. |
| FAFSA/TASFA Priority Deadline | January 15, 2026 | 14 Critical deadline. Must file by this date to "maximize your eligibility" for financial aid. |
| Scholarship Interest Form Deadline | January 15, 2026 | 18 Critical deadline. Must complete this separate form in the MyStatus portal to be considered for institutional scholarships. |
| Early Action Decision Release | By January 15, 2026 | 14 |
| Regular Decision Release | By February 15, 2026 | 14 |
| Honors Decisions Release | March 1, 2026 | 14 |

---

**Context:** A Comprehensive Admissions Research Report: The University of Texas, Austin > III. The Application Gauntlet: Key Dates, Requirements, and Strategic Considerations > Strategic Analysis: Early Action vs. Regular Decision

**C. Strategic Analysis: Early Action vs. Regular Decision**

The university's Early Action plan (October 15 deadline) is non-binding.
14 An analysis of the
 stated benefits indicates that its primary, and perhaps only, tangible advantage is an earlier
 notification date-January 15 versus February 15 for regular applicants.
15

The provided materials do not state a competitive advantage for applying Early Action.
The
 true deadline for all serious applicants, particularly those targeting selective majors or
 scholarships, is December 1. This is the hard deadline for programs like Engineering 21 and
 Business 22, and for consideration for the Forty Acres Scholars Program.
23 Therefore, a rushed
 application to meet the October 15 deadline is a poor strategy.
Applicants should use the
 additional six weeks to perfect their application, essays, and any required supplemental
 materials for the December 1 deadline.

**Context:** A Comprehensive Admissions Research Report: The University of Texas, Austin > IV. Analysis of High-Demand Programs: Admission to Competitive Colleges > The "University of Silos" Model and McCombs School of Business

**IV. Analysis of High-Demand Programs: Admission to
 Competitive Colleges**

Admission to UT Austin is not a single, unified process.
It is a "university of silos," where
 admission to high-demand colleges and majors is a separate, more rigorous, and often
 non-holistic process at its initial stages.
Failure to meet these major-specific requirements
 can result in rejection from that major, even if the applicant is otherwise qualified for general
 university admission.
24 The "competitiveness of the major" is a primary factor in the
 admissions review. 15

**A. The "University of Silos" Model: A Strategic Overview**

Applicants must select a first-choice and second-choice major. 24 For high-demand programs,
 selecting a first-choice major triggers a separate, binary review.
For example: "Did the
 applicant meet the Calculus Readiness requirement? Yes/No." "Did the applicant submit the
 required 3-image PDF? Yes/No."

A "No" on this binary check will, according to university policy, result in the applicant being
 removed from consideration for that major, regardless of their other "holistic" qualities like
 essays or extracurriculars.
24 The general holistic review 15 is secondary to passing through
 these "gates."
An applicant's preparation and supplemental materials must be perfectly
 tailored to their first-choice major.

**B. Deep Dive: McCombs School of Business (BBA)**

* **Selectivity:** The McCombs School of Business is designated as "very competitive".
22 Its
 selectivity has surpassed that of the university at large by a significant margin.
The BBA
 acceptance rate was 11% for Fall 2024 25 and fell to just 9% for Fall 2025.22
* **Admitted Profile:** The academic profile of students admitted for Fall 2024 reflects this
 intense competition: an average SAT of 1470, an average ACT of 33, and an average class
 rank in the Top 4.0%.
25
* **Application Requirement:** To be considered, an applicant must list "Unspecified
 Business" (200400) as their first-choice major on the Common App.
22
* **Analysis:** McCombs is an Ivy-League-selectivity admission, even for Texas residents.
The
 overall in-state acceptance rate is ~41%³, but the McCombs-specific rate is ~9%.22 This
 indicates it is approximately four times more selective than the university's baseline for
 in-state students.
The admitted student profile (Top 4.0% rank) 25 confirms that even
 students with an automatic admission guarantee (Top 6% in-state) are not guaranteed a
 spot in McCombs;
they are competing in a pool where the average admit has a higher
 class rank.
Failure to list "Unspecified Business" as the first choice is a fatal,
 non-recoverable application error.

**Context:** A Comprehensive Admissions Research Report: The University of Texas, Austin > IV. Analysis of High-Demand Programs: Admission to Competitive Colleges > Cockrell School of Engineering and Computer Science

**C. Deep Dive: Cockrell School of Engineering (All Majors)**

* **Application Requirement:** All freshman applicants to all majors within the Cockrell
 School of Engineering must demonstrate the "Calculus Readiness Requirement" by the
 admissions deadline.
21
* **How to Satisfy Requirement:** This is a binary check. The applicant must provide
 evidence of one of the following 26.
    * SAT Math score of 620 or higher
    * ACT Math score of 26 or higher
    * Advanced Placement (AP) Calculus AB or BC test score of 3 or higher
    * International Baccalaureate (IB) HL Mathematics score of 4 or higher
    * Official college transcript with credit for a college-level Calculus I (or higher) course
 with a grade of "B" or higher.
* **Analysis:** This requirement is a non-negotiable filter. The university's language ("must
 demonstrate") 26 is absolute.
This is not a "holistic" component; it is a gate.
An applicant
 with a 4.0 GPA, perfect essays, and a 1550 SAT will be rejected from Engineering if their
 SAT Math subscore is 610 and they have no other calculus credential.
26 This is a critical
 "hidden" requirement that applicants must verify they meet before submitting their
 application.

**D. Deep Dive: College of Natural Sciences (Computer Science)**

* **Selectivity:** The Computer Science major is designated as a "restricted entry-level
 major".
30 This high-demand status also applies to the Neuroscience major.
30
* **Application Requirement:** Applicants must select "Computer Science Entry-level" in
 the College of Natural Sciences on their application.32
* **Analysis:** The "restricted" designation 30 means there is no "back-door" pathway.
The
 university explicitly states that students in other Natural Sciences majors cannot simply
 change their major into CS;
it requires a separate, highly competitive internal transfer
 process. 30 This means an applicant's one and only opportunity to be a CS major is on
 their initial freshman application.
The acceptance rate for this major is not published, but
 its "restricted" status implies it is not the general university rate (~29%) or even the
 general College of Natural Sciences rate, but a much lower figure on par with McCombs
 (~9-11%).

**Context:** A Comprehensive Admissions Research Report: The University of Texas, Austin > IV. Analysis of High-Demand Programs: Admission to Competitive Colleges > School of Architecture and College of Fine Arts

**E. Deep Dive: School of Architecture**

* **Application Requirement:** In addition to the standard application, Architecture
 applicants must submit two supplemental items by the deadline 27:
    1.  **Short Answer (250-300 words):** A specific prompt on the "capacity to impact the
 world around us" and what that "opportunity to develop such capacity means to
 you".
27
    2.  **Creative Submission:** A single PDF document containing three (3) images (e.g.,
 personal photos, drawings, creative content, mixed media) that "visually tell the
 story" of their interest in the major, supported by a 50-75 word written narrative.27
* **Analysis:** While some university materials refer to portfolios as "optional" 33, these
 supplemental items are required.
27 This 3-image PDF functions as a de facto creative
 mini-portfolio.
It is designed to test skills beyond academics: creative thinking, visual
 communication, and the ability to follow technical directions (i.e., "one PDF document").
The prompt is explicitly designed to filter for students with the "interest, aptitude, and
 dedication to pursue a design education" 33, not just those with high academic statistics.

**F. Deep Dive: College of Fine Arts (CoFA)**

* **Application Requirement:** Requirements are not college-wide; they are
 major-specific. 34 This creates a "silo-within-a-silo" application process.
* **Major-Specific Requirements** 35.
    * **Studio Art (BA/BFA):** Requires a portfolio of 12-15 artworks (at least two from direct
 observation) and an artist statement. 35
    * **Art Education:** No portfolio required. 35
    * **Art History:** No additional materials required. 35
    * **Theatre & Dance (BFA):** Requires a headshot and 3 pre-screen audition videos. 35
    * **Arts & Entertainment Technologies:** No additional materials required. 35
* **Analysis:** This is the most complex set of requirements. An applicant to "Art Education" 36
 or "Arts and Entertainment Technologies" 35 will be evaluated holistically on their
 academic application alone. An applicant to "Studio Art" 37 or "Acting BFA" 35 will be
 evaluated primarily on their talent via a portfolio or audition.
Applicants must read the
 exact requirements for their intended major to avoid a critical application error.

 competitive "silo" programs.

**Table 4: Comparative Analysis of Selective Major Application Requirements**

| College / Program | Additional Requirement(s) | Key Strategic Factor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **McCombs (Business)** | Must list "Unspecified Business" as first choice. 22 | Hyper-competitive. Acceptance rate is ~9%.22 Average admit profile is Top 4% rank/1470 SAT. 25 |
| **Cockrell (Engineering)** | Must meet "Calculus Readiness" (e.g., SAT-M 620+ or AP 3+).26 | This is a binary filter. Failure to meet this = automatic rejection from the major. 26 |
| **CNS (Computer Science)** | Must list "Computer Science Entry-level" as first choice. 32 | "Restricted" major. 30 No internal transfer "back-door" pathway is available for students. |
| **School of Architecture** | 1) Design-based short answer. 2) 3-image "visual story" in a single PDF. 27 | A de facto creative portfolio that tests aptitude and visual thinking, not just academics. 33 |
| **COFA (Studio Art)** | 12-15 piece portfolio and artist statement.36 | A traditional, talent-based portfolio review. |
| **COFA (Acting BFA)** | Headshot and 3 pre-screen audition videos.35 | A traditional, talent-based audition. |
| **COFA (Art Education)** | None.35 | A standard holistic, academic-based review. |
| **COFA (Arts & Ent. Tech)** | None.35 | A standard holistic, academic-based review. |

**Context:** A Comprehensive Admissions Research Report: The University of Texas, Austin > V. Inventory of Academic Programs: Undergraduate Degrees, Minors, and Certificates > Strategic Application of Academic Inventory

**C. Strategic Application of Academic Inventory**

This academic inventory is a critical tool for strategic application planning.
First, it informs the "Second-Choice Major" decision. University policy states that an
 applicant rejected from their first-choice major (e.g., a "silo" program) "may be considered"
 for their second choice.
24 Given the sub-11% acceptance rates for McCombs, CS, and OOS
 applicants, the majority of these applicants will likely be evaluated on their second choice.
This choice is therefore not a "throwaway" but a critical fallback.
A high-risk, high-reward
 strategy (e.g., 1. Business, 2. Computer Science) is statistically unwise.
A more resilient
 strategy would be: 1. Business (McCombs), 2. Economics (College of Liberal Arts).
The
 inventory above provides the map for this decision.

Second, this inventory provides a "Plan B" Pathway. If an applicant is rejected from
 McCombs but admitted to their second choice of Economics, they are not locked out of the
 business school.
The inventory 42 shows that McCombs offers a "Business Foundations" minor
 and an "Elements of Business" certificate, which are open to non-business majors.
This allows
 the student to major in Economics while still gaining a formal, transcript-recognized credential
 from the business school, accessing its curriculum, faculty, and recruiting ecosystem.

**Context:** A Comprehensive Admissions Research Report: The University of Texas, Austin > VI. Financial Analysis: 2025-2026 Cost of Attendance and Aid Strategy > Estimated Cost of Attendance

**VI. Financial Analysis: 2025-2026 Cost of Attendance
 and Aid Strategy**

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the financial investment required for
 attendance, based on the most recently published 2025-2026 data.

**Α. 2025-2026 Estimated Cost of Attendance (COA)**

The following table itemizes the estimated COA for a full-time undergraduate student for the
 2025-2026 academic year, comparing Texas residents and non-residents.

**Table 5: 2025-2026 Estimated Cost of Attendance (Resident vs. Non-Resident)**

| Cost Category | Texas Resident (On-Campus) | Non-Texas Resident (On-Campus) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tuition | \$10,858-\$13,576 | \$38,650-\$46,498 |
| Housing and Food | \$15,420-\$15,510 | \$15,420-\$15,510 |
| Transportation | \$1,786 | \$1,786 |
| Books & Supplies | \$720 | \$720 |
| Personal / Misc. | \$3,560 | \$3,560 |
| **Total Estimated COA** | **\$32,344 - \$35,152** | **\$64,040 - \$72,682** |
| Data sourced from. 45 | | |

The most significant finding from this data is the "\$32,000 Non-Resident Premium."
The
 minimum estimated COA for a Texas resident is \$32,344, while the minimum for a non-resident
 is \$64,040.45 This difference of over \$31,700 per year-or more than \$126,000 for a four-year
 degree-creates an extreme financial barrier.
When combined with the 11.76% OOS
 acceptance rate³, this barrier makes UT Austin one of the most difficult and expensive public
 universities for non-residents to attend.

Furthermore, the tuition figures are presented as a range because they are not uniform
 across the university.
Tuition rates vary by college and major. 46 Programs in the Cockrell
 School of Engineering and the McCombs School of Business, for example, charge higher
 tuition rates than those in the College of Education or College of Liberal Arts.
47 Therefore, an
 applicant's choice of major has a direct impact on their total cost of attendance.

**B. Financial Aid Application Strategy**

To be considered for financial aid, applicants must submit the Free Application for Federal
 Student Aid (FAFSA) or the Texas Application for State Financial Aid (TASFA).
18
The Priority Deadline for filing these forms is January 15.14 The university states that filing
 by this date will "maximize your eligibility" for financial aid awards.14 In institutional practice,
 "priority" means that aid funds-particularly institutional grants and work-study, which are
 finite-are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis to qualified applicants.
Applicants
 who submit the FAFSA after the January 15 deadline are applying for a much smaller, or
 potentially non-existent, pool of institutional grant aid.
A student who waits until they receive
 an admissions decision (e.g., February 15) to file their FAFSA will have already missed this
 critical deadline and likely forfeited significant "free money" (grants and scholarships).

**VII. Scholarship & Merit Aid: The Forty Acres Program
 and Institutional Awards**

Securing merit aid at UT Austin requires a two-pronged strategy that involves navigating both
 institutional processes and the university's premier scholarship program.

**A. Institutional Scholarships (The "Scholarship Interest Form")**

The university states that there is "no separate scholarship application" for incoming
 freshmen. 49 This statement can be misleading.
While there is no single, large application,
 applicants must take a critical, non-obvious step to be considered for institutional awards.

1.  After submitting the main Common Application, applicants gain access to the MyStatus
 portal.20
2.  Within this portal, they must find and complete the "Scholarship Interest Form".
20
3.  The deadline to complete this form is January 15.18

This form is a mandatory opt-in for institutional scholarships, including major private
 foundation awards like the Terry Foundation.
20 An applicant who submits a perfect Common
 App and FAFSA but fails to complete this form in MyStatus by the January 15 deadline may be
 automatically disqualified from consideration for this aid.
The complete financial strategy
 must be: 1) Submit Common App by December 1; 2) Log in to MyStatus;
3) Complete the
 Scholarship Interest Form by January 15; and 4) Complete the FAFSA by January 15.

**Context:** A Comprehensive Admissions Research Report: The University of Texas, Austin > VII. Scholarship & Merit Aid: The Forty Acres Program and Institutional Awards > Forty Acres Scholars Program

**B. The Forty Acres Scholars Program: An In-Depth Profile**

The Forty Acres Scholars Program is the "premier full-ride, merit-based scholarship" at UT
 Austin. 50

* **Benefits:** The scholarship is a full ride, covering tuition, a living stipend, a book stipend,
 and "generous enrichment funds" for opportunities like study abroad, research, and
 professional development.
51
* **Eligibility:** The program is open to both in-state and out-of-state high school seniors.
Transfer students and international students are not eligible.23
* **Application Process:** There is no standalone application for the scholarship.
51
 Candidates are automatically identified from the general freshman admissions pool.
Selected semi-finalists are then contacted by the program and asked to complete
 additional steps. 51
* **Analysis:** While the selection process appears automatic, the eligibility criteria contain a
 critical, "hidden" prerequisite.
Program materials state: "Applicants applying to the
 McCombs School of Business should also apply to the Canfield Business Honors
 Program". 23 This strongly implies that the Forty Acres selection committee begins its
 search within the university's various honors program applicant pools. A high-achieving
 applicant to McCombs who fails to also complete the separate Canfield Honors
 application 22 may be inadvertently disqualifying themselves from consideration for the
 Forty Acres Scholarship. The clear strategic implication is that any applicant who hopes
 to be a serious contender for the Forty Acres Scholars Program must also apply to their
 respective honors program (e.g., Canfield Business Honors, Engineering Honors, Plan II).

**Context:** A Comprehensive Admissions Research Report: The University of Texas, Austin > VIII. Advanced Credit and Transfer Equivalency Policies > AP & IB Examination Credit and Transfer Credit

**VIII. Advanced Credit and Transfer Equivalency
 Policies**

UT Austin maintains transparent policies for applicants to maximize any academic credit
 earned prior to matriculation.

**A. AP & IB Examination Credit**

* **Advanced Placement (AP):** The university has a generous AP policy, awarding course
 credit for at least one course for all AP exams with a score of 3 or higher.
The only
 exceptions are AP Comparative Government, AP Research, and AP Seminar, for which no
 credit is awarded.52
* **International Baccalaureate (IB):** Credit is awarded for qualifying scores on Higher
 Level (HL) exams.
The specific credit awarded differs for students earning the full IB
 Diploma versus those with IB Certificates or individual course awards.52
* **Search Tool:** Applicants can use the university's "Search for Exams" tool to see the exact
 course equivalencies for their scores (e.g., an AP Calculus BC score of 3 grants credit for
 M 408C).52

This generous AP policy creates a significant strategic advantage. As noted in Section IV, an
 AP Calculus score of 3 57 both satisfies the binary admissions requirement for the Cockrell
 School of Engineering 26 and grants credit for the first-semester calculus course.
This allows
 an admitted student to enter with credit, advance to higher-level coursework immediately, and
 free up space in their schedule for other requirements or a minor.

**B. Community College & Transfer Credit**

The university provides a high level of transparency for transfer students, particularly those
 within the Texas public college system.

* **ATE System:** The public-facing Automated Transfer Equivalency (ATE) System is the
 university's official database of more than 300,000 transfer credit evaluations.
58
* **TCCNS:** For all Texas public community colleges and universities, this system is
 standardized by the Texas Common Course Numbering System (TCCNS).60

These public-facing tools "demystify" the in-state transfer process. A student at any Texas
 community college (e.g., Austin Community College 61) can use the TCCNS to find the exact
 course equivalent for a UT Austin requirement.
They can then verify this equivalency in the
 ATE database 59 to see precisely how the credit will transfer.
This creates a guaranteed,
 transparent, and low-cost pathway from any Texas community college to UT Austin, which is a
 core function of the state's public education infrastructure.

**Context:** A Comprehensive Admissions Research Report: The University of Texas, Austin > IX. Strategic Synthesis and Recommendations for Prospective Applicants > Texas Resident Personas

**IX. Strategic Synthesis and Recommendations for
 Prospective Applicants**

This analysis yields distinct sets of actionable recommendations tailored to UT Austin's
 primary applicant personas.

**A. Persona 1: The Texas Auto-Admit (Top 6% of High School Class)**

* **Synthesis:** Admission to the university is guaranteed by state law. Admission to the
 major of choice is not.
The application is therefore not a plea for admission; it is a
 competition for major placement.
* **Strategic Recommendations:**
    1.  **Prioritize Standardized Tests:** The SAT/ACT score is the primary differentiator
 against thousands of other auto-admits with 4.0 GPAs.
The university's own data 10
 shows they believe a high score (median 1420 for submitters) predicts success.
A
 high score is essential for placement into a high-demand "silo" (McCombs, Cockrell,
 CS).
    2.  **Satisfy Binary Requirements:** The applicant must satisfy the major-specific
 requirements detailed in Section IV. They must verify their "Calculus Readiness" 26 for
 Engineering or curate their 3-image PDF 24 for Architecture.
Failure here will void the
 auto-admit advantage for that major.
    3.  **Use the Second-Choice Major Strategically:** The applicant should list their
 high-demand major as their first choice 22 and a related, non-silo major as their
 second choice (e.g., 1. Business, 2. Economics).
24

**B. Persona 2: The Texas Holistic Review (Not Top 6%)**

* **Synthesis:** This is the most competitive domestic pool, competing for the approximately
 15% of in-state seats not reserved for auto-admits.
* **Strategic Recommendations:**
    1.  **Meet Academic Benchmarks:** The applicant's academic profile must be well within
 the university's middle 50% (3.75-4.0 GPA, 1230-1480 SAT, 29-34 ACT).
There is no
 "guarantee," so the academic record must be flawless.
    2.  **Optimize Narrative:** Essays and short answers are critical for differentiation.
The
 applicant must build a compelling narrative of why they, over another highly qualified
 Texan, deserve a spot.
    3.  **Be Strategic With Major Choice:** Applying to a "silo" major (Section IV) is a
 high-risk, high-reward proposition.
The safest path to general admission is likely
 through a non-silo program in the College of Liberal Arts 40, College of Education 40,
 or School of Social Work.
40

**Context:** A Comprehensive Admissions Research Report: The University of Texas, Austin > IX. Strategic Synthesis and Recommendations for Prospective Applicants > Out-of-State Applicant Persona

**C. Persona 3: The Out-of-State (OOS) Applicant**

* **Synthesis:** This is the single most difficult admissions pool. OOS applicants are
 competing for 10% of the class seats , face an 11.76% acceptance rate 3, and must also
 overcome a ~\$32,000/year non-resident cost premium.
45
* **Strategic Recommendations:**
    1.  **Categorize as "High Reach":** UT Austin must be classified as a "High Reach" school,
 regardless of the applicant's profile.
It cannot be considered a "match" or "safety."
    2.  **Exceed Academic Benchmarks:** The academic profile must be in the top 25% of
 the admitted class 13, not the middle 50%.
An OOS applicant for Engineering, for
 example, should aim to exceed the "Calculus Readiness" minimum (e.g., an AP score
 of 5, not the minimum 3 26).
    3.  **Apply for Honors:** The applicant must apply for their respective Honors Program
 (e.g., Canfield, Engineering Honors). This is the implied pathway to be considered for
 the Forty Acres Scholars Program 51, which is one of the only full-ride, merit-based
 awards open to OOS students.
    4.  **Secure Financial Plan:** The applicant must have a clear financial plan to cover the
 \$64,040 - \$72,682 annual COA.
45 Significant institutional need-based or merit aid
 is exceptionally rare for this cohort.
