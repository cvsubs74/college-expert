An Institutional Analysis of the University of California, Santa Barbara
I. Institutional Profile and Administrative Context
The University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is a public, land-grant research university and a member of the 10-campus University of California (UC) system.
Tracing its origins to 1891, the institution joined the UC system in 1944, making it the third-oldest campus in the system.
The university's academic and research prestige is affirmed by its membership in the Association of American Universities (AAU) and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU).¹

**A. Institutional Overview: Key Metrics and Strategic Identity**
As of Fall 2024, UC Santa Barbara enrolls a total student population of 26,133, composed of 23,181 undergraduates and 2,952 postgraduate students.
The institution is supported by 4,378 academic staff.
Under the leadership of Chancellor Dennis Assanis, the university manages significant financial resources, including a 2023 operating budget of \$1.032 billion and a 2024 endowment valued at \$665.9 million.
These metrics establish UCSB as a mid-sized, financially substantial, and research-intensive public university.

**Context:** An Institutional Analysis of the University of California, Santa Barbara > I. Institutional Profile > Governance and Budgetary Process

**B. Governance and Budgetary Process: A Top-Down, Constrained Model**
An analysis of UC Santa Barbara's internal administrative structure reveals a highly centralized and resource-constrained budgetary process. A 2023 audit report (08-23-0014) on the university's Budget Allocation Process characterizes the prevailing methodology as a "top-down approach resulting from a tight budget".2

This top-down model has significant operational consequences. The audit notes that in recent years, proactive consultation has "mainly occurred at the division level and not at the department level".2 The Office of Budget and Planning (OBP) provided justification for this structure, noting that department-level consultation would require resources beyond its capacity.
Specifically, the Budget Office's staffing of three Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) is tasked with overseeing 380 campus departments, a ratio that makes widespread departmental consultation operationally prohibitive.2

The 2023 audit identified several key deficiencies stemming from this model, including:
* A need for enhanced and updated guidelines to ensure "some level of common practices" for budget planning across campus divisions.
* A finding that "resolution plans agreed upon with the divisions are not formalized."
* A recommendation for enhanced "budget-related top-down information" to improve community-wide understanding of high-level financial decisions.
* A call for "budget-related training to all users of the process". 2

**Context:** An Institutional Analysis of the University of California, Santa Barbara > I. Institutional Profile > Administrative Transition & IRPA Role

In response to these challenges, UC Santa Barbara is actively engaged in a major administrative transition.
The university is implementing a new Oracle Financial System, a project that includes the OBP "developing new budget processes and tools" in collaboration with campus Business Officers and Financial Officers.
This initiative includes the development of new "control point dashboards," presumably to address the lack of formalized, common-practice monitoring.2

**C. The Role of Institutional Research, Planning & Assessment (IRPA)**
The university's central data-governance body is Institutional Research, Planning & Assessment (IRPA), operating under the Office of Budget & Planning.³ IRPA's stated mission is to provide "high quality, accurate and timely statistical information and analytical studies to campus leaders and decision-makers in support of evidence-based planning, evaluation and assessment".3

IRPA's core functions are multi-faceted and critical to institutional operations:
* **Enrollment Management:** Supporting the campus's enrollment goals by "maintaining near-term and long-term enrollment projection models" and "conducting statistical studies of yield" for admitted students.³
* **Academic Assessment:** Providing "data and support to departments undergoing Academic Program Review, including support for the assessment of program learning outcomes".3
* **Institutional Effectiveness:** Coordinating, designing, and analyzing "surveys of UC Santa Barbara students, alumni, faculty and staff".3
* **Compliance:** Ensuring compliance with all "Federal, State, Regional Accreditation (WASC) and UC System reporting requirements".3

---

**Context:** An Institutional Analysis of the University of California, Santa Barbara > I. Institutional Profile > Data Repositories & Operational Tension

IRPA manages the university's primary public-facing data repositories, including the Campus Profile, New Student Profiles, and Retention and Graduation Rates.3
A key instrument managed by IRPA is the Common Data Set (CDS).
The CDS is a standardized report developed by a consortium of higher education publishers (including the College Board, Peterson's, and U.S. News & World Report) and institutional data providers.
Its goal is to improve the quality, accuracy, and comparability of institutional data while reducing the reporting burden on universities.
IRPA provides the university's 2024-2025 Common Data Set.3

The administrative structure of UCSB presents a significant operational tension between its data-gathering functions and its resource-allocation processes.
On one hand, IRPA is explicitly tasked with providing data to support department-level Academic Program Reviews and learning-outcome assessments.
This represents a bottom-up, data-driven approach to academic evaluation.
On the other hand, the university's budgeting process, as confirmed by the 2023 audit, is explicitly "top-down" and bypasses departmental consultation in favor of divisional-level allocation, a structure justified by the Budget Office's severe staffing constraints (3.0 FTES for 380 departments).2
This creates a structural disconnect. A department may undergo a rigorous, data-informed program review that identifies critical resource needs, but that department has no formal, direct channel to the budget-allocation process.
The feedback loop is broken at the divisional level. The ongoing implementation of a new Oracle Financial System and its associated "control point dashboards" 2 is a high-stakes initiative precisely because it is the university's primary mechanism to resolve this tension.
The project's success or failure will determine whether the institution can bridge the gap between its bottom-up academic assessment and its top-down financial model.

**Context:** An Institutional Analysis of the University of California, Santa Barbara > II. Academic Organization > Three-College Model

**II. Academic Organization and Programmatic Structure**
The university's undergraduate education is delivered through a three-college model, with each college possessing a distinct academic identity, programmatic scope, and admissions process.5

**A. Analysis of the Three-College Undergraduate Model**

**1. College of Letters & Science (L&S):** This is the largest college at UC Santa Barbara, serving as the institution's liberal arts and sciences core.
It houses over 80 undergraduate majors across more than 45 departments. 6

**2. The Robert Mehrabian College of Engineering (COE):** A highly selective, specialized college ranked "among the top engineering schools in the world".
It is characterized by an "interdisciplinary and innovative" approach and offers five distinct undergraduate B.S. majors.5

**3. The College of Creative Studies (CCS):** Founded in 1967, CCS is a unique academic entity within the university.
It is described as a "portal for high-achieving, ambitious students" and functions as a "graduate school for undergraduates."
It features a separate, faculty-reviewed application process and nine specialized majors.

**B. Comprehensive Academic Offerings: Majors and Minors**
The following tables provide a comprehensive inventory of all undergraduate majors and minors offered at UC Santa Barbara, aggregated from the official university academic catalog.

The academic structure is not entirely siloed. The Gevirtz Graduate School of Education (GGSE) actively participates in undergraduate education by offering three distinct minors: Applied Psychology, Educational Studies, and Science and Mathematics Education.
This indicates a strategic, programmatic inter-penetration, likely designed to create a pipeline for undergraduates into GGSE's graduate and credentialing programs.
The Science and Mathematics Education minor, with its "Secondary (Grades 7-12) Track" for STEM undergraduates, is a clear pathway to guide L&S and CoE majors into teaching careers, addressing a key state-level workforce need. 12

Furthermore, the College of Letters & Science employs specific bureaucratic policies to enforce its pedagogical goal of academic breadth.
Catalog rules stipulate two key restrictions: (1) a student may not pursue a minor within the same department as their major (with few exceptions), and (2) no more than 5 upper-division units may overlap between a student's major and minor.
15 These rules are structural impediments to over-specialization. They algorithmically enforce a liberal arts education by ensuring students use their elective units in a "cohesive supplement" 15 outside their primary discipline, thereby protecting the academic integrity and unit counts of both programs.

**Context:** An Institutional Analysis of the University of California, Santa Barbara > III. Freshman Admission > Overall Profile & Requirements

**III. Freshman Admission and Selection Analysis**
UC Santa Barbara's freshman admission process is complex, defined by a trifurcated model that applies fundamentally different selection criteria depending on the applicant's chosen college.

**A. Overall Freshman Admission Profile**
Based on the most recent data, UC Santa Barbara received 93,442 freshman applications and admitted 27,719 students, for an overall admit rate of 29.7%.16
The university adheres to the UC system's "comprehensive review" process, which evaluates applicants on a wide range of academic and personal factors.
16 To be eligible, applicants must complete the UC-approved A-G subject requirements with a 'C' grade or better and meet a minimum A-G GPA requirement of 3.0 for California residents and 3.4 for non-California residents.7
Crucially, UC Santa Barbara is fully test-blind. The institution's policy states it "will not consider SAT or ACT test scores when making admissions or scholarship decisions".17 Scores may only be used for course placement after a student has enrolled. 18

---

**Context:** An Institutional Analysis of the University of California, Santa Barbara > III. Freshman Admission > College-Specific Selection Criteria

**B. A Trifurcated Admissions Model: College-Specific Selection Criteria**
The 29.7% overall admit rate is a blended average that masks three functionally separate and distinct admissions processes.

**1. College of Letters & Science (L&S): "Major-Blind" Admission**
For the vast majority of applicants to the College of Letters & Science, the stated policy is that the "Choice of major is not considered" in the admission decision.7 A supplemental application is not required.
This "major-blind" policy has one significant exception: applicants to the performing arts majors of Dance or Music Performance must complete an audition, which is factored into the admission decision.7

**2. The Robert Mehrabian College of Engineering (COE): Major-Specific, High-Demand Admission**
Admission to the College of Engineering is highly selective and strictly major-specific.
The college's policy, driven by high demand, is that it "will not consider alternate Engineering major choices".7 Applicants are instead encouraged to select an alternate major in the College of Letters & Science as their second choice.6
Screening for CoE is based on factors beyond the UC minimums, specifically:
* GPA in college preparatory courses.
* Completion of coursework beyond the minimum A-G requirements.
* "Completion of advanced placement and honors courses, particularly those in science and math".19

While the UC system requires 3 years of math (4 recommended) 17, the CoE "strongly recommends" a high school program that includes 2 years of algebra, 1 year of plane geometry, 1 year of pre-calculus/calculus, and 1 year of both physics and chemistry.20 In a competitive applicant pool, these "recommendations" function as the de facto requirements for selection.

**Context:** An Institutional Analysis of the University of California, Santa Barbara > III. Freshman Admission > College of Creative Studies Supplemental Application

**3. The College of Creative Studies (CCS): A Dual-Application, Faculty-Reviewed Process**
Admission to the College of Creative Studies requires two separate applications.
First, the applicant must complete the standard UC application (due December 1, 2025 for the Fall 2026 cycle).21 Second, "All applicants must submit a supplemental application, which is reviewed by Creative Studies faculty".7
Applicants must submit the UC application first and then use their assigned UC Application ID to access the separate CCS supplemental application.21 The priority deadline for the CCS supplemental application for Fall 2026 is January 6, 2026.21 This supplemental, faculty-led review requires distinct materials for each of the nine CCS majors, as detailed below.21

**Table III.A: College of Creative Studies (CCS) Supplemental Application Requirements (Fall 2026)**

| CCS Major | Letter of Intent | Letters of Recommendation | Supplemental Materials / Portfolio |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Art** | Required | Optional (List persons familiar with your work) | **Required:** Portfolio of 15-20 works (one PDF), separate image list. |
| **Biology** | Required | Required (At least two) | **Encouraged:** Examples of independent research, scientific reports, etc. |
| **Chemistry & Biochemistry** | Required | Required (At least two) | **Encouraged:** Examples of independent research, reports, etc. |
| **Computing** | Required | Required (At least two) | **Encouraged:** Examples of independent research, reports, code, etc. |
| **Marine Science** | Required (Most important part of application) | Not explicitly mentioned in 21 | **Encouraged:** Evidence of interest (research, observations, etc.). |
| **Mathematics** | Required | Not explicitly mentioned in 21 | **Encouraged:** Examples of independent research, reports, etc. |
| **Music Composition** | Required (1-3 page questionnaire) | Required (At least two) | **Required:** Minimum of two fully notated scores. **Recommended:** Recordings |
| **Physics** | Required | Required (At least two) | **Required:** PDF listing all AP test scores and highest math level completed. **Encouraged:** Research examples. |
| **Writing & Literature** | Required (2-3 pages, specific prompts) | Not Required (Do not solicit) | **Required:** Writing sample (up to 10 pages) including both creative and expository writing. |

**Context:** An Institutional Analysis of the University of California, Santa Barbara > III. Freshman Admission > Pre-Major System & Enrollment Management

**C. The "Pre-Major" System: Post-Enrollment Admission Barriers in L&S**
The "major-blind" admission policy of the College of Letters & Science is a strategic measure that masks a "second gate" of admission for the college's most popular and resource-intensive programs.
This "pre-major" system defers selectivity from the point of freshman admission to the end of the sophomore year, allowing UCSB to admit a large, undeclared-style cohort while strictly capping enrollment in impacted majors.

**1. Case Study 1: The Biological Sciences "Iron Gate"**
This is the most restrictive example. The university's policy states, "All freshmen requesting any of the 10 biology majors are admitted to the BA as Pre-Biology Majors".23 These students must then complete a rigorous preparatory sequence in chemistry, mathematics, physics, and introductory biology.
They may only petition to declare the full B.A. or B.S. major "once this common coursework is completed, usually at the end of their sophomore year," and only if they have maintained a 2.0 GPA in all attempted major coursework.23
However, this path is only available to students admitted as "Pre-Biology." A separate, emphatic policy note states: "You may not change into a biology major after enrollment at UCSB".25 This creates an "iron gate": selection for the biology pathway occurs at the freshman application stage, and the decision is irreversible.

**2. Case Study 2: The Economics "GPA Hurdle"**
A similar, but performance-based, gate exists for Economics. Freshmen are admitted as "Pre-Economics".26 To be admitted to the full Economics (B.A.) or Economics & Accounting (B.A.) major, students must complete a specific set of pre-major courses (e.g., ECON 1, 2, 10A).
The critical barrier is that these courses must be completed with a minimum 2.85 GPA.28
The policy explicitly warns students, "Acceptance into the pre-major does not guarantee admission to full major status".26 Any student who fails to meet the 2.85 GPA threshold in the pre-major sequence is barred from the major.

This "dual-gate" system is a core component of UCSB's enrollment management strategy. It transfers the risk of selectivity from the admissions office (Gate 1) to the student's academic performance in their first two years (Gate 2).
It allows the university to maintain a high-applicant, "big tent" liberal arts identity while simultaneously creating a high-pressure, "weed-out" environment to protect its most impacted programs.
The consequence is that the initial UC application is a high-stakes, binding, and often irreversible decision.
A student interested in Biology must select Pre-Biology, or they are permanently barred. 25 A student interested in Engineering must be accepted to their specific major in CoE, as alternate CoE majors are not considered and internal transfers are notoriously difficult. 29 An applicant to L&S History receives a "major-blind" review, while an applicant to CCS Art undergoes a rigorous, faculty-led portfolio review. 21 In effect, a prospective student is not applying to one university, but navigating a choice between three different institutional tracks (L&S, COE, CCS), each with its own opaque and binding set of rules.

**Context:** An Institutional Analysis of the University of California, Santa Barbara > IV. Academic Credit > Advanced Placement (AP) Policies

**IV. Academic Credit and Articulation Policies**
The university maintains a highly specific set of policies for awarding academic credit from external sources, including Advanced Placement (AP) exams, International Baccalaureate (IB) exams, and courses from California Community Colleges (CCCs).

**A. Advanced Placement (AP) Credit Policy**
UC Santa Barbara grants 8 quarter units for each AP exam passed with a score of 3, 4, or 5.30 Credit is not awarded for duplicated work, such as an AP exam and an IB exam in the same subject. 31
A critical distinction in UCSB's policy is the separation of unit credit (which counts toward graduation) and course equivalency (which exempts a student from a specific course). This policy is used to strategically manage the university's foundational curriculum.

**Table IV.A: Advanced Placement (AP) Credit Policy for Select Examinations**

| AP Exam | Score | Units Awarded | UCSB Course Equivalent / GE Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Calculus BC** | 3, 4, or 5 | 8 | Yes: Math 3A-3B (or 34A-3B). (GE: 2 C-area courses, Quant. Relations) 31 |
| **Chemistry** | 3, 4, or 5 | 8 | No Course Equivalent. (GE: 1 C-area course, Quant. Relations) 31 |
| **Computer Science A** | 3 | 8 | No Course Equivalent. (GE: 1 C-area course, Quant. Relations) 31 |
| **Computer Science A** | 4 or 5 | 8 | Yes: Computer Science 8. (GE: 1 C-area course, Quant. Relations) 31 |
| **Physics C: Mechanics** | 3, 4, or 5 | 4 | Yes: Physics 6A + 6AL. (GE: 1 C-area course, Quant. Relations) 31 |
| **Physics C: E&M** | 3, 4, or 5 | 4 | Yes: Physics 6B + 6BL. (GE: 1 C-area course, Quant. Relations) 31 |
| **English (Lang or Lit)** | 3 | 8 | Yes: Satisfies Entry Level Writing. (Writing 1, 1E) 31 |
| **English (Lang or Lit)** | 4 | 8 | Yes: Satisfies Entry Level Writing. (Writing 1, 1E, 2, 2E) 31 |
| **English (Lang or Lit)** | 5 | 8 | Yes: Satisfies Entry Level Writing. (Writing 1, 1E, 2, 2E, 50, 50E) 31 |

Note on conflicting data: The system-wide UC admissions portal 30 states AP Physics C exams earn units but no course equivalent.
However, the official UC Santa Barbara catalog 31-which serves as the binding document for enrolled students-explicitly grants course equivalency for Physics 6A/AL and $6B/BL$.
This analysis relies on the campus-specific catalog as the authoritative source.

---

**Context:** An Institutional Analysis of the University of California, Santa Barbara > IV. Academic Credit > International Baccalaureate & Transfer Articulation

**B. International Baccalaureate (IB) Credit Policy**
UC Santa Barbara grants 8 quarter units for Higher Level (HL) exams passed with a score of 5, 6, or $7\cdot^{34}$ The university does not grant credit for Standard Level (SL) exams. 34 Students who complete the full IB Diploma with a score of 30 or higher receive an additional 6 quarter units, separate from the units earned for individual HL exams. 34

**Table IV.B: International Baccalaureate (IB) HL Credit Policy for Select Examinations (Score 5-7)**

| IB HL Exam | Units Awarded | UCSB Course Equivalent / GE Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mathematics: Analysis & Approaches** | 8 | Yes: Math 3A-3B (or 34A-3B). GE(: 2 C-area courses, Quant. Relations) 34 |
| **Chemistry** | 8 | No Course Equivalent. (GE: 1 C-area course, Quant. Relations) 34 |
| **Physics** | 8 | Yes: Physics 10. (GE: 1 C-area course, Quant. Relations) 34 |
| **Biology** | 8 | Yes: EEMB 22, MCDB 20. (GE: 1 C-area course) 34 |

**C. Transfer and Articulation (California Community Colleges)**
For students transferring from California Community Colleges (CCCs), ASSIST.org is the official online tool that provides articulation agreements.
36 This system details which CCC courses are transferable, which satisfy UC Santa Barbara's General Education requirements, and which fulfill lower-division preparation for specific majors. 37
The university's policy allows students to transfer a maximum of 105 lower-division (LD) quarter units (equivalent to 70 semester units).
37 It is critical to note that CCC courses can only fulfill lower-division requirements and are not calculated into the student's UC GPA.37

These credit policies reveal a deliberate "gateway course" strategy, particularly in STEM. A student who earns a high score on the AP Calculus BC exam is granted full equivalency for the first-year math sequence. 31 However, a student who earns a 5 on the AP Chemistry exam and a 7 on the IB Chemistry HL exam receives 8 units of credit but no course equivalency. 31 That student must still enroll in and complete the entire introductory chemistry sequence at UC Santa Barbara.
This is a pedagogical policy choice that ensures every pre-medical and pre-biology student 23 is "level-set" and vetted by UCSB's own chemistry department, which serves as a critical academic checkpoint and filtering mechanism for impacted majors.

**Context:** An Institutional Analysis of the University of California, Santa Barbara > V. Financial Analysis > Institutional Scholarship Programs

**B. Analysis of Institutional Scholarship Programs**
The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships (OFAS) administers federal, state, and university aid programs. 42 The university's two flagship programs for incoming freshmen are the Regents Scholarship and the Chancellor's Scholarship.

**1. The Regents Scholarship (Merit-Based)**
* **Basis:** This is the "most prestigious scholarship" at the university, established in 1962 to recognize "outstanding academic achievement and promise". 43
* **Selection:** It is offered to students "within the top two percent of admitted freshmen" based only on a comprehensive review of the UC Application for Admission. No separate application is required. 43
* **Award:** \$5,000 per year, renewable for four years. 43
* **Maintenance:** Scholars must maintain a 3.20 quarterly and cumulative GPA. 43
* **Atypical Policy:** Unlike at many other UC campuses, the UCSB Regents Scholarship does not provide priority class registration. 45 This is a significant policy deviation that makes the scholarship's practical, non-monetary value lower than its counterparts, suggesting an institutional culture that prioritizes a more egalitarian registration-pass system.

**2. The Chancellor's Scholarship (Need-Based, Local)**
* **Basis:** This is a need-based scholarship awarded to students who demonstrate financial need via the FAFSA or California Dream Act Application. 46
* **Selection:** The scholarship is geographically restricted to incoming freshmen who graduated from high schools in Santa Barbara, Ventura, Kern, and San Luis Obispo counties. 46
* **Award:** \$3,000 per year, renewable for three additional years. 46
* **Maintenance:** This scholarship's requirements reveal its true purpose. To maintain the award, a student must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA and attend mandatory quarterly meetings with a counselor from the Educational Opportunity Program (ΕΟΡ).46
This mandatory counseling link demonstrates that the Chancellor's Scholarship is not a "runner-up" merit prize, but a strategic retention program. It targets high-achieving, high-need students from the university's local service area and integrates them into a high-touch, mandatory advising relationship, directly linking financial aid with proactive student-support services.

**3. Other Institutional Aid**
* **UCSB Promise Scholarship:** A program for high-need California (or AB540-eligible) residents, offering \$120,000 over four years for freshmen. 47
* **UCSB Scholarship:** A general grant for California residents who apply for aid "On-Time" and demonstrate sufficient financial need. 49
* **Scholarship Universe:** An online portal that allows enrolled students (with a UCSB Net ID) to find and apply for a wide range of external and university-specific scholarships. 42

**Context:** An Institutional Analysis of the University of California, Santa Barbara > VII. Concluding Analysis > Strategic Observations

**VII. Concluding Analysis and Strategic Observations**
This analysis reveals UC Santa Barbara as a complex, multi-faceted institution defined by specific and often-unconventional strategic models for managing selectivity, resources, and academic pathways.

**1. Key Finding: The "Dual-Gate" Selectivity Model.**
UC Santa Barbara's strategy for managing impacted programs is a "dual-gate" system.
The first gate is at freshman admission, and it is trifurcated: "major-blind" for L&S 7, highly restrictive and major-specific for CoE 7, and portfolio-based for CCS.21 The second gate is internal and occurs post-enrollment, where L&S manages its own impacted majors.
For Biology, this gate is an "iron wall" (no students may transfer in).25 For Economics, it is a "quantitative hurdle" (a 2.85 pre-major GPA).28 This model allows UCSB to maintain a large, inclusive L&S identity while simultaneously running highly competitive, capped programs, effectively transferring enrollment management risk from the institution to the student's academic performance during their first two years.

**2. Key Finding: Centralized, Strained, and Evolving Resource Model.**
The university's central budget process is operationally strained, characterized as "top-down".2 A structural disconnect exists: IRPA is tasked with supporting departmental-level academic planning 3, but the Budget Office's staffing (3 FTEs for 380 departments) 2 makes a top-down, divisional-level allocation model a necessity.
The institution is in a high-risk, high-reward administrative transition, with the implementation of a new Oracle Financial System 2 representing a forced evolution of its entire budget and planning framework. The success of this project is critical to resolving these documented internal tensions.

**3. Key Finding: A "Three-University" Structure.**
UCSB functions as three distinct entities sharing a single campus: a large-scale public university (L&S), a selective technical institute (CoE), and a bespoke "graduate school for undergraduates" (CCS).5 This structure allows UCSB to compete for three different student archetypes.
However, it creates an admissions system of profound and non-transparent complexity, where choices made on the single UC application (which college, which major) are often irreversible and carry consequences that are not immediately apparent to the applicant.

**4. Key Finding: Governance by Deliberate Policy Exception.**
The institution's character is defined by its deliberate deviations from peer-institution norms. These are not oversights but specific strategic choices.
The decision to withhold course equivalency for AP/IB Chemistry 31 is a pedagogical choice to "level-set" all STEM students and control its gateway courses.
The decision to withhold priority registration from its prestigious Regents Scholars 45 is an administrative choice that prioritizes an egalitarian registration system. These policies demonstrate an institution with a strong, and at times rigid, sense of its own administrative and pedagogical priorities.
